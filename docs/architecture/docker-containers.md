# Docker Container Architecture

When running DataHub via docker-compose. or helm, the following is a diagram of the containers involved
with running DataHub and their relationships with each other. The helm chart uses helm hooks to determine
the proper ordering of the components whereas docker-compose relies on a series of health checks.
