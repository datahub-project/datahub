# Search

<FeatureAvailability/>

The **search bar** is an important mechanism for discovering data assets in DataHub. From the search bar, you can find Datasets, Columns, Dashboards, Charts, Data Pipelines, and more. Simply type in a term and press 'enter'.

<p align="center">
<img width="70%"  src="https://github.com/datahub-project/static-assets/blob/main/imgs/search-landingpage.png?raw=true" />
</p>

**Advanced queries** and the **filter sidebar** helps fine tuning queries. For programmatic users Datahub provides a **GraphQL API** as well.

## Search Setup, Prerequisites, and Permissions

Search is available for all users. Although Search works out of the box, the more relevant data you ingest, the better the results are.

## Using Search

Searching is as easy as typing in relevant business terms and pressing 'enter' to view matching data assets.

By default, search terms will match against different aspects of a data assets. This includes asset names, descriptions, tags, terms, owners, and even specific attributes like the names of columns in a table.

### Search Operators

The default boolean logic used to interpret text in a query string is `AND`. For example, a query of `information about orders` is interpreted as `information AND about AND orders`.

### Filters

The filters sidebar sits on the left hand side of search results, and lets users find assets by drilling down. You can quickly filter by Data Platform (e.g. Snowflake), Tags, Glossary Terms, Domain, Owners, and more with a single click.

<p align="center">
 <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/filters_highlighted.png" />
</p>

### Advanced Filters

Using the Advanced Filter view, you can apply more complex filters. To get there, click 'Advanced' in the top right of the filter panel:

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/advanced_search/click_to_advanced_search_view.png"/>
</p>

#### Adding an Advanced Filter

Currently, Advanced Filters support filtering by Column Name, Container, Domain, Description (entity or column level), Tag (entity or column level), Glossary Term (entity or column level), Owner, Entity Type, Subtype, Environment and soft-deleted status.

To add a new filter, click the add filter menu, choose a filter type, and then fill in the values you want to filter by.

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/advanced_search/click_add_advanced_filter.png"/>
</p>

#### Matching Any Advanced Filter

By default, all filters must be matched in order for a result to appear. For example, if you add a tag filter and a platform filter, all results will have the tag and the platform. You can set the results to match any filter instead. Click on `all filters` and select `any filter` from the drop-down menu.

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/advanced_search/advanced_search_choose_matches_any.png"/>
</p>

#### Negating An Advanced Filter

After creating a filter, you can choose whether results should or should not match it. Change this by clicking the operation in the top right of the filter and selecting the negated operation.

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/advanced_search/advanced_search_select_negated.png"/>
</p>

### Results

Search results appear ranked by their relevance. In self-hosted DataHub ranking is based on how closely the query matched textual fields of an asset and its metadata. In DataHub Cloud, ranking is based on a combination of textual relevance, usage (queries / views), and change frequency.

With better metadata comes better results. Learn more about ingestion technical metadata in the [metadata ingestion](../../metadata-ingestion/README.md) guide.

### Advanced queries

The search bar supports advanced queries with pattern matching, logical expressions and filtering by specific field matches.

The following are use cases with example search phrases. Additionally, an example link is provided for our demo instance.
These examples are non exhaustive and using Datasets as a reference.

If you want to:

- Exact match on term or phrase

  - `"pet profile"` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%22pet%20profile%22)
  - `pet profile` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=pet%20profile)
  - Enclosing one or more terms with double quotes will enforce exact matching on these terms, preventing further tokenization.

- Exclude terms

  - `logging -snowflake` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=logging%20-snowflake)
  - Results can be excluded by term using `-` to negate the term.

- Term boolean logic with precedence

  - `logging + (-snowflake | os_audit_log)` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=logging%20%2B%20%28-snowflake%20%7C%20os_audit_log%29)
  - `(` `)` can be used to set precedence of boolean term expressions

- Find a dataset with the word **mask** in the name:

  - `/q name: *mask*` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20name%253A%2520%2Amask%2A)
  - This will return entities with **mask** in the name. Names tends to be connected by other symbols, hence the wildcard symbols before and after the word.

- Find a dataset with a property, **encoding**

  - `/q customProperties: encoding*` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20customProperties%3A%20encoding%2A)
  - Dataset Properties are indexed in ElasticSearch the manner of key=value. Hence if you know the precise key-value pair, you can search using `"key=value"`. However, if you only know the key, you can use wildcards to replace the value and that is what is being done here.

- Find an entity with an **unversioned** structured property

  - `/q structuredProperties.io_acryl_privacy_retentionTime01:60`
  - This will return results for an **unversioned** structured property's qualified name `io.acryl.private.retentionTime01` and value `60`.
  - `/q _exists_:structuredProperties.io_acryl_privacy_retentionTime01`
  - In this example, the query will return any entity which has any value for the **unversioned** structured property with qualified name `io.acryl.private.retentionTime01`.

- Find an entity with a **versioned** structured property

  - `/q structuredProperties._versioned.io_acryl_privacy_retentionTime.20240614080000.number:365`
  - This query will return results for a **versioned** structured property with qualified name `io.acryl.privacy.retentionTime`, version `20240614080000`, type `number` and value `365`.
  - `/q _exists_:structuredProperties._versioned.io_acryl_privacy_retentionTime.20240614080000.number`
  - Returns results for a **versioned** structured property with qualified name `io.acryl.privacy.retentionTime`, version `20240614080000` and type `number`.
  - `/q structuredProperties._versioned.io_acryl_privacy_retentionTime.\*.\*:365`
  - Returns results for a **versioned** structured property with any version and type with a values of `365`

- Find a dataset with a column name, **latitude**

  - `/q fieldPaths: latitude` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20fieldPaths%3A%20latitude)
  - fieldPaths is the name of the attribute that holds the column name in Datasets.

- Find a dataset with the term **latitude** in the field description

  - `/q editedFieldDescriptions: latitude OR fieldDescriptions: latitude` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20editedFieldDescriptions%3A%20latitude%20OR%20fieldDescriptions%3A%20latitude)
  - Datasets has 2 attributes that contains field description. fieldDescription comes from the SchemaMetadata aspect, while editedFieldDescriptions comes from the EditableSchemaMetadata aspect. EditableSchemaMetadata holds information that comes from UI edits, while SchemaMetadata holds data from ingestion of the dataset.

- Find a dataset with the term **logical** in the dataset description

  - `/q editedDescription: *logical* OR description: *logical*` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20editedDescription%3A%20%2Alogical%2A%20OR%20description%3A%20%2Alogical%2A)
  - Similar to field descriptions, dataset descriptions can be found in 2 aspects, hence the need to search 2 attributes.

- Find a dataset which resides in one of the browsing folders, for instance, the **hive** folder

  - `/q browsePaths: *hive*` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?page=1&query=%2Fq%20browsePaths%3A%20%2Ahive%2A)
  - BrowsePath is stored as a complete string, for instance `/datasets/prod/hive/SampleKafkaDataset`, hence the need for wildcards on both ends of the term to return a result.

- Find a dataset without the **name** field
  - `/q -_exists_:name` [Sample results](https://demo.datahub.com/search?filter_entity___false___EQUAL___0=DATASET&page=1&query=%252Fq%2520-_exists_%253Aname&unionType=0)
  - the `-` is negating the existence of the field name.

### GraphQL

- [searchAcrossEntities](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/graphql/queries/#searchacrossentities)
- You can try out the API on the demo instance's public GraphQL interface: [here](https://demo.datahub.com/api/graphiql)

The same GraphQL API that powers the Search UI can be used
for integrations and programmatic use-cases.

```
# Example query - search for datasets matching the example_query_text who have the Dimension tag applied to a schema field and are from the data platform looker
query searchEntities {
  search(
    input: {
      type: DATASET,
      query: "example_query_text",
      orFilters: [
        {
          and: [
            {
              field: "fieldTags",
              values: ["urn:li:tag:Dimension"]
            },
            {
              field: "platform",
              values: ["urn:li:dataPlatform:looker"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      start: 0,
      count: 10
    }
  ) {
    start
    count
    total
    searchResults {
      entity {
        urn
        type
        ... on Dataset {
          name
          platform {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Searching at Scale

For queries that return more than 10k entities we recommend using the [scrollAcrossEntities](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/graphql/queries/#scrollacrossentities) GraphQL API:

```
# Example query
{
  scrollAcrossEntities(input: { types: [DATASET], query: "*", count: 10}) {
    nextScrollId
    count
    searchResults {
      entity {
        type
        ... on Dataset {
          urn
          type
          platform {
            name
          }
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will return a response containing a `nextScrollId` value which must be used in subsequent queries to retrieve more data, i.e:

```
{
  scrollAcrossEntities(input:
    { types: [DATASET], query: "*", count: 10,
    scrollId: "eyJzb3J0IjpbMy4wLCJ1cm46bGk6ZGF0YXNldDoodXJuOmxpOmRhdGFQbGF0Zm9ybTpiaWdxdWVyeSxiaWdxdWVyeS1wdWJsaWMtZGF0YS5jb3ZpZDE5X2dlb3RhYl9tb2JpbGl0eV9pbXBhY3QucG9ydF90cmFmZmljLFBST0QpIl0sInBpdElkIjpudWxsLCJleHBpcmF0aW9uVGltZSI6MH0="}
  ) {
    nextScrollId
    count
    searchResults {
      entity {
        type
        ... on Dataset {
          urn
          type
          platform {
            name
          }
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In order to complete scrolling through all of the results, continue to request data in batches until the `nextScrollId` returned is null or undefined.

### DataHub Blog

- [Using DataHub for Search & Discovery](https://medium.com/datahub-project/using-datahub-for-search-discovery-fa309089be22)

## Customizing Search

It is possible to completely customize search ranking, filtering, and queries using a search configuration yaml file.
This no-code solution provides the ability to extend, or replace, the Elasticsearch-based search functionality. The
only limitation is that the information used in the query/ranking/filtering must be present in the entities' document,
however this does include `customProperties`, `tags`, `terms`, `domain`, as well as many additional fields.

Additionally, multiple customizations can be applied to different query strings. A regex is applied to the search query
to determine which customized search profile to use. This means a different query/ranking/filtering can be applied to
a `select all`/`*` query or one that contains an actual query.

Search results (excluding select `*`) are a balance between relevancy and the scoring function. In
general, when trying to improve relevancy, focus on changing the query in the `boolQuery` section and rely on the
`functionScore` for surfacing the _importance_ in the case of a relevancy tie. Consider the scenario
where a dataset named `orders` exists in multiple places. The relevancy between the dataset with the **name** `orders` and
the **term** `orders` is the same, however one location may be more important and thus the function score preferred.

**Note:** The customized query is a pass-through to Elasticsearch and must comply with their API, syntax errors are possible.
It is recommended to test the customized queries prior to production deployment and knowledge of the Elasticsearch query
language is required.

### Enable Custom Search

The following environment variables on GMS control whether a search configuration is enabled and the location of the
configuration file.

Enable Custom Search:

```shell
ELASTICSEARCH_QUERY_CUSTOM_CONFIG_ENABLED=true
```

Custom Search File Location:

```shell
ELASTICSEARCH_QUERY_CUSTOM_CONFIG_FILE=search_config.yml
```

The location of the configuration file can be on the Java classpath or the local filesystem. A default configuration
file is included with the GMS jar with the name `search_config.yml`.

### Search Configuration

The search configuration yaml contains a simple list of configuration profiles selected using the `queryRegex`. If a
single profile is desired, a catch-all regex of `.*` can be used.

The list of search configurations can be grouped into 4 general sections.

1. `queryRegex` - Responsible for selecting the search customization based on the [regex matching](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp) the search query string.
   _The first match is applied._
2. Built-in query booleans - There are 3 built-in queries which can be individually enabled/disabled. These include
   the `simple query string`[[1]](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html),
   `match phrase prefix`[[2]](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-match-query-phrase-prefix.html), and
   `exact match`[[3]](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-term-query.html) queries,
   enabled with the following booleans
   respectively [`simpleQuery`, `prefixMatchQuery`, `exactMatchQuery`]
3. `boolQuery` - The base Elasticsearch `boolean query`[[4](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-bool-query.html)].
   If enabled in #2 above, those queries will
   appear in the `should` section of the `boolean query`[[4](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-bool-query.html)].
4. `functionScore` - The Elasticsearch `function score`[[5](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#score-functions)] section of the overall query.

#### Examples

These examples assume a match-all `queryRegex` of `.*` so that it would impact any search query for simplicity.

##### Example 1: Ranking By Tags/Terms

Boost entities with tags of `primary` or `gold` and an example glossary term's uuid.

```yaml
queryConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*

    simpleQuery: true
    prefixMatchQuery: true
    exactMatchQuery: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            terms:
              tags.keyword:
                - urn:li:tag:primary
                - urn:li:tag:gold
          weight: 3.0

        - filter:
            terms:
              glossaryTerms.keyword:
                - urn:li:glossaryTerm:9afa9a59-93b2-47cb-9094-aa342eec24ad
          weight: 3.0

      score_mode: multiply
      boost_mode: multiply
```

Similar example to boost with `primary` AND `gold` instead of the previous OR condition.

```yaml
queryConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*

    simpleQuery: true
    prefixMatchQuery: true
    exactMatchQuery: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            bool:
              filter:
                - term:
                    tags.keyword: urn:li:tag:primary
                - term:
                    tags.keyword: urn:li:tag:gold
          weight: 3.0

      score_mode: multiply
      boost_mode: multiply
```

##### Example 2: Preferred Data Platform

Boost the `urn:li:dataPlatform:hive` platform.

```yaml
queryConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*

    simpleQuery: true
    prefixMatchQuery: true
    exactMatchQuery: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            terms:
              platform.keyword:
                - urn:li:dataPlatform:hive
          weight: 3.0
      score_mode: multiply
      boost_mode: multiply
```

##### Example 3: Exclusion & Bury

This configuration extends the 3 built-in queries with a rule to exclude `deprecated` entities from search results
because they are not generally relevant as well as reduces the score of `materialized`.

```yaml
queryConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*

    simpleQuery: true
    prefixMatchQuery: true
    exactMatchQuery: true

    boolQuery:
      must_not:
        term:
          deprecated:
            value: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            term:
              materialized:
                value: true
          weight: 0.5
      score_mode: multiply
      boost_mode: multiply
```

##### Example 4: Entity Ranking

Alter the ranking of entities. For example, chart vs dashboard, you may want the dashboard
to appear above charts. This can be done using the following function score and leverages a prefix match on the entity type
of the URN. Depending on the entity the weight may have to be adjusted based on your data and the entities
involved since often multiple field matches may shift weight towards one entity vs another.

```yaml
queryConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*

    simpleQuery: true
    prefixMatchQuery: true
    exactMatchQuery: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            prefix:
              urn:
                value: "urn:li:dashboard:"
          weight: 1.5
      score_mode: multiply
      boost_mode: multiply
```

### Search Autocomplete Configuration

Similar to the options provided in the previous section for search configuration, there are autocomplete specific options
which can be configured.

Note: The scoring functions defined in the previous section are inherited for autocomplete by default, unless
overrides are provided in the autocomplete section.

For the most part the configuration options are identical to the search customization options in the previous
section, however they are located under `autocompleteConfigurations` in the yaml configuration file.

1. `queryRegex` - Responsible for selecting the search customization based on the [regex matching](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_regex.asp) the search query string.
   _The first match is applied._
2. The following boolean enables/disables the function score inheritance from the normal search configuration: [`inheritFunctionScore`]
   This flag will automatically be set to `false` when the `functionScore` section is provided. If set to `false` with no
   `functionScore` provided, the default Elasticsearch `_score` is used.
3. Built-in query booleans - There is 1 built-in query which can be enabled/disabled. These include
   the `default autocomplete query` query,
   enabled with the following booleans
   respectively [`defaultQuery`]
4. `boolQuery` - The base Elasticsearch `boolean query`[[4](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-bool-query.html)].
   If enabled in #2 above, those queries will
   appear in the `should` section of the `boolean query`[[4](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-bool-query.html)].
5. `functionScore` - The Elasticsearch `function score`[[5](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-function-score-query.html#score-functions)] section of the overall query.

#### Examples

These examples assume a match-all `queryRegex` of `.*` so that it would impact any search query for simplicity. Also
note that the `queryRegex` is applied individually for `searchConfigurations` and `autocompleteConfigurations` and they
do not have to be identical.

##### Example 1: Exclude `deprecated` entities from autocomplete

```yaml
autocompleteConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*
    defaultQuery: true

    boolQuery:
      must:
        - term:
            deprecated: "false"
```

#### Example 2: Override scoring for autocomplete

```yaml
autocompleteConfigurations:
  - queryRegex: .*
    defaultQuery: true

    functionScore:
      functions:
        - filter:
            term:
              materialized:
                value: true
          weight: 1.1
        - filter:
            term:
              deprecated:
                value: false
          weight: 0.5
      score_mode: avg
      boost_mode: multiply
```

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

**How are the results ordered?**

The order of the search results is based on the weight what Datahub gives them based on our search algorithm. The current algorithm in OSS DataHub is based on a text-match score from Elasticsearch.

**Where to find more information?**

The sample queries here are non exhaustive. [The link here](https://demo.datahub.com/tag/urn:li:tag:Searchable) shows the current list of indexed fields for each entity inside Datahub. Click on the fields inside each entity and see which field has the tag `Searchable`.  
However, it does not tell you the specific attribute name to use for specialized searches. One way to do so is to inspect the ElasticSearch indices, for example:  
`curl http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices` returns all the ES indices in the ElasticSearch container.
