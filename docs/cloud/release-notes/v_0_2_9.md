# v0.2.9
---

Release Availability Date
---
28-June-2023

Recommended CLI/SDK
---
- `v0.10.4.3` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.10.4.3

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, github actions, airflow, in python SDK somewhere, Java SKD etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI and it helps us support you better.

Special Notes
- We have a new search and browse experience. We cannot enable it unless all of your CLI/SDK usages are upgraded. If you are using a custom source then you need to upgrade your source to produce `browsePathv2` aspects.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] If you are using our okta source to do ingestion then you MUST read this. Okta source config option `okta_profile_to_username_attr` default changed from `login` to `email`. This determines which Okta profile attribute is used for the corresponding DataHub user and thus may change what DataHub users are generated by the Okta source. And in a follow up `okta_profile_to_username_regex` has been set to `.*` which taken together with previous change brings the defaults in line with OIDC which is used for login via Okta.
- [DEPRECATION] In the DataFlow class, the cluster argument is deprecated in favor of env.
