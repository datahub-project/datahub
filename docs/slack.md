## Slack Guidelines

In addition to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), we expect all Slack Community Members to respect the following guidelines:

### Avoid using DMs and @mentions

Whenever possible, post your questions and responses in public channels so other Community Members can benefit from the conversation and outcomes. Limit the use of @mentions of other Community Members to be considerate of notification noise.

### Make use of threads

Threads help us keep conversations contained and help us ensure we help you find a resolution and get you the support you need.

Use threads when posting long messages and large blocks of code and/or stack trace - it is a MASSIVE help for us to keep track of the large volume of questions across our various support channels.

### Do not post the same question across multiple channels

If you're having a tough time getting the support you need (or aren't sure where to go!), please DM [@Maggie](https://datahubspace.slack.com/team/U0121TRV0FL) for support

### Do not solicit members of our Slack

The DataHub Community exists to collaborate with, learn from, and support one another. It is not a space to pitch your products or services directly to our members via public channels, private channels, or direct messages.

We are excited to have a growing presence from vendors to help answer questions from Community Members as they may arise, but we have a strict 3-strike policy against solicitation:

1. First occurrence: We'll give you a friendly but public reminder that the behavior is inappropriate according to our guidelines.
2. Second occurrence: We'll send you a DM warning that any additional violations will result in removal from the community.
3. Third occurrence: We'll delete or ban your account.

We reserve the right to ban users without notice if they are clearly spamming our Community Members.
