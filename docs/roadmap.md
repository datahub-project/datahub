# DataHub Roadmap

## [The DataHub Roadmap has a new home!](https://feature-requests.datahubproject.io/roadmap)

Please refer to the [new DataHub Roadmap](https://feature-requests.datahubproject.io/roadmap) for the most up-to-date details of what we are working on!

_If you have suggestions about what we should consider in future cycles, feel free to submit a [feature request](https://feature-requests.datahubproject.io/) and/or upvote existing feature requests so we can get a sense of level of importance!_

## Historical Roadmap

_This following represents the progress made on historical roadmap items as of January 2022. For incomplete roadmap items, we have created Feature Requests to gauge current community interest & impact to be considered in future cycles. If you see something that is still of high-interest to you, please up-vote via the Feature Request portal link and subscribe to the post for updates as we progress through the work in future cycles._
