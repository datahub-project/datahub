# Redshift Ingestion Guide: Overview

## What You Will Get Out of This Guide

This guide will help you set up the Redshift connector through the DataHub UI to begin ingesting metadata into DataHub.

Upon completing this guide, you will have a recurring ingestion pipeline that will extract metadata from Redshift and load it into DataHub. This will include to following Redshift asset types:

- Database
- Schemas (External and Internal)
- Tables (External and Internal)
- Views

This recurring ingestion pipeline will also extract:

- **Usage statistics** to help you understand recent query activity
- **Table-level lineage** (where available) to automatically define interdependencies between datasets
- **Table- and column-level profile statistics** to help you understand the shape of the data

:::caution
The source currently can ingest one database with one recipe
:::
