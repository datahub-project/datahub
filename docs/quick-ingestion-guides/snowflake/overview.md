# Snowflake Ingestion Guide: Overview

## What You Will Get Out of This Guide

This guide will help you set up the Snowflake connector to begin ingesting metadata into DataHub.

Upon completing this guide, you will have a recurring ingestion pipeline that will extract metadata from Snowflake and load it into DataHub. This will include to following Snowflake asset types:

- Databases
- Schemas
- Tables
- External Tables
- Views
- Materialized Views

The pipeline will also extract:

- **Usage statistics** to help you understand recent query activity (available if using Snowflake Enterprise edition or above)
- **Table- and Column-level lineage** to automatically define interdependencies between datasets and columns (available if using Snowflake Enterprise edition or above)
- **Table-level profile statistics** to help you understand the shape of the data

:::caution
You will NOT have extracted Stages, Snowpipes, Streams, or Tasks from Snowflake, as the connector does not support ingesting these assets yet.
:::

### Caveats

By default, DataHub only profiles datasets that have changed in the past 1 day. This can be changed in the YAML editor by setting the value of `profile_if_updated_since_days` to something greater than 1.

Additionally, DataHub only extracts usage and lineage information based on operations performed in the last 1 day. This can be changed by setting a custom value for `start_time` and `end_time` in the YAML editor.

_To learn more about setting these advanced values, check out the [Snowflake Ingestion Source](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/generated/ingestion/sources/snowflake/#module-snowflake)._
