# Microsoft Teams App Features

<FeatureAvailability saasOnly />

The DataHub Microsoft Teams App brings several of DataHub's key capabilities directly into your Teams experience.
The integration enables your team to:

1. Ask DataHub about your data (by tagging @DataHub)
2. Receive notifications when Data Assets change
3. Manage Data Incidents

The Teams App makes data discovery easier and more accessible, by making DataHub available where you work.
Learn more about [how to set up the Teams app](./saas-teams-setup.md).

## Ask DataHub in Teams

Simply mention @DataHub in any channel or chat to ask questions about your data. Some popular use cases include:

- Search for data assets using natural language.
- Understand the impact of changes to data assets.
- Dig into specific asset context - their glossary terms, owners, and more.
- Write SQL queries to perform specific analysis.

## Get Notified

To get personal notifications via Teams, you must first [connect your teams account](./saas-teams-setup#connecting-your-teams-account).

The DataHub Teams app enables you to be notified in specific Teams channels or direct messages when important changes to your Data Assets occur.
Notification preferences & subscriptions [can be configured](../subscription-and-notification.md) in the DataHub UI once the [Teams app is set up](./saas-teams-setup.md).

## Manage Data Incidents

One of the most common use cases for the Teams app is incident management.
When an incident is raised, you will get notified about its impact, priority, and more.
You will also be able to directly resolve the incident, or dive deeper into DataHub, directly from Teams.

To learn more about DataHub incident management, check out the [Incidents](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/incidents/incidents/) feature guide.
