# Troubleshoot Slack Issues

<FeatureAvailability saasOnly />

This document provides troubleshooting guidance for the Slack integration. For more details on setting up the Slack integration, [click here](./saas-slack-setup.md).

## Prerequisites - Testing the Slack Integration

First and foremost, we recommend using the 'Send a test notification' feature to verify whether the issue is with the integration setup, slack's systems, or DataHub. The modal will provide a rich description of an error if there is one.
You can access this feature either by going to the Notifications page in your settings, or a subscription drawer.

## Test notification failed with 'Re-Connect DataHub to Slack'

There are several reasons why sending a test notification would fail. The description in the modal should give you insights as to what's broken and what you can do to resolve this issue.
If you're seeing a message that recommends the DataHub admin to re-connect Slack to DataHub, you may want to try the following options:

### Refresh the existing app installation (Recommended)

:::note
Whomever originally installed the Slack app will need to perform this.
If they are unable to do this, you may need to go down the 'Install a new app' path below.
:::

1. Get your App Config tokens by following the first few steps outlined in the [installation guide](https://docs.datahub.com/docs/managed-datahub/slack/saas-slack-setup/#step-by-step-guide). If it's showing expired tokens, feel free to delete them and create a new set.
2. Paste them into their respective text inputs, and hit **'Re-connect'**
<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/saas/slack/re_connect_1.png"/>
</p>
3. You will be re-directed to a page where you can finalize the app refresh.

### Install a new app

:::note
If you choose to install a new app, your team will have to re-add the new bot into any private channels the old one was previously in.
If you'd like support in getting a list of the private channels that are subscribed to Slack notifications on DataHub, please reach out to your customer success representative.

## Test notification works, but not receiving notifications

There are a few reasons why you may not receive notifications when you'd expect.

### Actors do not receive notifications for their actions

If you've subscribed to an entity, and then performed an action (i.e., raised an incident or added a tag), you will not be notified about your own action.

### There is an issue with DataHub's systems

If sending a test notification works, and you've verified that none of the above cases apply, then you should contact your DataHub Customer Success rep to help troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## Slack bot issues

Below you'll find some tips to troubleshoot issues with your Slack bot.

### Command failed with error "dispatch_failed"

If you've installed the Slack bot, but your commands are failing with an error 'dispatch_failed', you can try the following to correct it.

1. Open your DataHub cloud instance with the following url: `<your-instance-base-url>/settings/integrations/slack?display_all_configs=true`.
2. Switch to the **Bot Token** tab.
<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/saas/slack/verify_tokens_1.png"/>
</p>
3. The values will be `**`'d out, but if any of these fields are empty (ie. Signing Secret), then you'll want to fill them in.
4. Visit [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps), and open your currently installed app. You will see fields like `App ID` and `Signing Secret` here:

  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/saas/slack/verify_tokens_2.png"/>
</p>
5. You can get your `Bot Token` from the **OAuth & Permissions** tab in the side nav.
<p align="center">
  <img width="70%"  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datahub-project/static-assets/main/imgs/saas/slack/verify_tokens_3.png"/>
</p>
6. Paste the values in and hit **Update Configuration**.
7. Test the Slack command now and it should work. If it still fails, please reach out to your DataHub Cloud admin to troubleshoot further.
