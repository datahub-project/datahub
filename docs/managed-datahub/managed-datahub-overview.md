# How DataHub Cloud compares to DataHub

DataHub is the #1 open source data catalog for developers.

DataHub Cloud takes DataHub to the next level by offering features that allow
you to roll out the product to the entire organization beyond your central data
platform team.

We’ve organized this comparison using a few categories. We love well-organized
checklists and we hope you love them too!
