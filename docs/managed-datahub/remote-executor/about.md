# About Remote Executor

<FeatureAvailability saasOnly />

## Overview

The Remote Executor is a powerful feature of DataHub Cloud that enables secure metadata ingestion from private sources while maintaining full control over credentials and network access. It serves as a bridge between your private infrastructure and DataHub Cloud, allowing you to:

- Ingest metadata and execute DataHub Cloud Observe monitors from sources behind firewalls or in private networks
- Monitor ingestion sources and run assertions from within your environment

## Key Benefits

### Security & Control

- Credentials stay in your environment
- Network access controlled by your policies
- Support for AWS Secrets Manager integration and all secret management systems accessible by [External Secrets Operator](https://external-secrets.io/latest/provider/aws-secrets-manager/)
- Full audit trail of execution activities

### Enterprise-Ready Integration & Operations

- Compatible with all DataHub Ingestion Sources
- Easy deployment on various platforms (AWS ECS, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Multiple executor support for high availability
- Built-in monitoring and observability
- Enterprise-grade support, eliminating the complexity of self-managed solutions

## Architecture

The Remote Executor works by:

1. Deploying as a container in your environment
2. Establishing a secure connection to DataHub Cloud
3. Receiving and executing Ingestion and Observe tasks
4. Reporting results back to DataHub Cloud

This architecture ensures that:

- All sensitive operations occur within your environment
- No inbound connections are required
- Your security policies remain intact

## Next Steps

To get started with Remote Executor:

1. Review the [Configuring Remote Executor](../operator-guide/setting-up-remote-ingestion-executor.md) guide for deployment instructions
2. See the [Monitoring Remote Executors](monitoring.md) guide

## FAQ

### Is Remote Executor required for DataHub Cloud?

No, DataHub Cloud comes with an managed executor by default. Remote Executor is an optional feature for cases where you need to ingest from private sources or maintain stricter control over credentials and network access.

### Can I use multiple Remote Executors?

Yes, you can deploy multiple Remote Executors for high availability or to handle different security zones. Contact your DataHub Cloud representative for details.

### What platforms are supported?

Remote Executor can be deployed on various platforms including:

- Amazon ECS
- Kubernetes (v1.28+)
  - Cloud-agnostic deployment supporting all major cloud providers (AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, etc.)
  - Compatible with self-managed Kubernetes clusters
- Other container platforms (contact DataHub team for details)

### How secure is the Remote Executor?

The Remote Executor is designed with security as a top priority:

- All credentials remain in your environment
- No inbound connections required
- Support for secret management systems
- Regular security updates
