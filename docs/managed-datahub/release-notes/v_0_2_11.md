# v0.2.11

---

## Release Availability Date

14-Sep-2023

## Recommended CLI/SDK

- `v0.11.0` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.11.0
- [Deprecation] In LDAP ingestor, the manager_pagination_enabled changed to general pagination_enabled

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, github actions, airflow, in python SDK somewhere, Java SKD etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI and it helps us support you better.

## Special Notes

- Deployment process for this release is going to have a downtime when systme will be in a read only mode. A rough estimate 1 hour for every 2.3 million entities (includes soft-deleted entities).

## Release Changelog

---

- Since `v0.2.10` these changes from OSS DataHub https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/compare/2b0952195b7895df0a2bf92b28e71aac18217781...75252a3d9f6a576904be5a0790d644b9ae2df6ac have been pulled in.
- Misc fixes & features
  - Proposals
    - Group names shown correctly for proposal Inbox
  - Metadata tests
    - Deprecate/Un-deprecate actions available in Metadata tests
    - Last Observed (in underlying sql) available as a filter in metadata tests
    - [Breaking change] Renamed `__lastUpdated` -> `__created` as a filter to correctly represent what it was. This was not surfaced in the UI. But if you were using it then this needs to be renamed. DataHub Cloud CustomerSuccess team will keep an eye out to pro-actively find and bring this up if you are affected by this.
    - Robustness improvements to metadata test runs
    - Copy urn for metadata tests to allow for easier filtering for iteration over metadata test results via our APIs.
  - A lot more fixes to subscriptions, notifications and Observability (Beta).
