If you are using an older CLI/SDK version then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, github actions, airflow, in python SDK somewhere, Java SKD etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI and it helps us support you better.
