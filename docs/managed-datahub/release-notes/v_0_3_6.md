## Release Changelog

- Breaking Changes

  - Automatic downgrade to a previous release is not supported. Please reach out to support if required.
  - Metadata tests that are created/edited will not automatically run on a small batch (less than 10,000 assets) immediately anymore, but instead will rely on the scheduled run. Scheduled runs and metadata tests running on asset changes are unimpacted. This bug is fixed in 0.3.6.1.
