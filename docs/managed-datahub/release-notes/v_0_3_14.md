## Release Changelog

### v0.3.14-acryl

New Features:

- **Power User Recommendations**: Enable admins to quickly identify power users of data platforms and drive adoption by targeting colleagues who are most likely to benefit from DataHub's capabilities.
- **Support Widget**: DataHub Cloud's users with `Admin` role will see a `Get Support` option in Navbar. That can be used to raise support tickets to our team. This is currently meant only for Admin users and over time we may enable this for more users.
- **Sample Tab for Ingestion**: For users using the recommended CLI, in most cases will see a Sample Tab on Ingestion Run status Modal. That will share examples of assets that have lineage, usage or profiling available. This can help users validate that important details are being ingested by ingestion connectors.
- **New Advanced search queries**: In our [search doc](../../how/search.md) 2 additional advanced search queries will be available. These are marked as available in `0.3.14.x` release of DataHub Cloud.
- **Sending full logs from remote executor (Optioanl)**: We now have an option of DataHub Cloud customers running [remote executor](../remote-executor/about.md) to allow shipping full logs to DataHub. These logs (in this release) will only be accessible to our team to help debug the ingestion issues faster. This is an optional feature that you can give your approval to our team so they can enable it from our side. This requires upgrading DataHub Cloud server on DataHub side and customers upgrading remote executor on their end. This new feature allows remote executor to upload logs directly to S3 buckets. In future releases we may plan to use existing communication channels to upload logs to DataHub side instead of direct S3 uploads.
