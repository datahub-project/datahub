Fixes:

- Snowflake - introduces support for private key auth
- Data health dashboard link sharing on the 'By Assertion' tab was broken. This is now patched.
- Slack alerts for legacy assertion failures now correctly route to the assertion.
- In some instances with corrupted legacy assertions, other non-corrupted assertions stopped showing on dataset pages due to failures of an MCP Upgrade Step. This is now resolved.

- Fixes an error page that can occasionally happen after clicking the executor name in your ingestion list that takes you to the list of executors
