# v0.3.7

---

## Release Availability Date

13-Nov-2024

## Recommended CLI/SDK

- `v0.14.1.12` with release notes at https://github.com/datahub/datahub/releases/tag/v0.14.1.12

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version, then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, GitHub Actions, Airflow, in Python SDK somewhere, Java SDK, etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade, as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI, and it helps us support you better.

## Known Issues

- Persistence Exception: No Rows Updated may occur if a transaction does not change any aspect's data.

### v0.3.7.8

- Notes Feature
  - Adding a Note to an entity will result in that note showing up in the Settings > Home Page list of announcements as well as the profile page of the entity.
  - If more than 30 Notes are added to entities, there's a risk that home page announcements will not show up on the home page properly.
  - Notes are only supported for Dataset and Column entities in this release.

### v0.3.7.7

- Postgres regression, non-functional when using postgres

### v0.3.7.3

- Search page fails to render when filters are applied with a query which returns zero results.

          datahub:
            timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
      ```
  - #11486 - Criterion's `value` parameter has been previously deprecated. Use of `value` instead of `values` is no longer supported and will be completely removed on the next major version.
  - #10472 - `SANDBOX` added as a FabricType. No rollbacks allowed once metadata with this fabric type is added without manual cleanups in databases.

  - #11570 - If a `datahub_api` is explicitly passed to a stateful ingestion config provider, it will be used. We previously ignored it if the pipeline context also had a graph object.
  - #11518 - DataHub Garbage Collection: Various entities that are soft-deleted (after 10d) or are timeseries _entities_ (dataprocess, execution requests) will be removed automatically using logic in the `datahub-gc` ingestion source.

  - (system / internal) Exclude form-prompt tests in live Metadata Tests evaluation
  - (system / internal) Exclude form-prompt tests in stored Metadata Test results
  - Elasticsearch reindex time limit of 8h removed
  - Data Product Properties Unset side effect introduced
    - Previously, Data Products could be set as linked to multiple Datasets if modified directly via the REST API rather than linked through the UI or GraphQL. This side effect aligns the REST API behavior with the GraphQL behavior by introducting a side effect that enforces the 1-to-1 constraint between Data Products and Datasets
    - NOTE: There is a pathological pattern of writes for Data Products that can introduce issues with write processing that can occur with this side effect. If you are constantly changing all of the Datasets associated with a Data Product back and forth between multiple Data Products it will result in a high volume of writes due to the need to unset previous associations.
