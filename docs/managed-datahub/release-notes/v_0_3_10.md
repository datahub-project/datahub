## Recommended CLI/SDK

1.0.0.2

## Helm Chart

## Known Issues

- API Tracing: Some aspects (i.e. `siblings`) which can be generated by system hooks are reported as a trace error if the system aspect and ingestion are creating conflicting aspects.
- When enabling the `ONLINE_SMART_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED` feature flag in gms, customers must have their remote executors on v0.3.10.2 or higher for the new feature to work. Furthermore, offline pipeline driven smart assertions must be disabled.

### v0.3.10.1

- All changes in https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/releases/tag/v1.0.0

- Known Bugs

  - [Remote Executor] The env var `ONLINE_SMART_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED` will need to be enabled in the remote excecutor for online smart assertions to work.
  - [Forms] There is a bug in the bulk by question Forms experience where if you apply filters, change the search query, change page, or change page size the modal to fill the form out closes. This is fixed in `v0.3.10.2` which is a recommended version over this version.
  - [Manage Ingestion] Styling changes affected the ability to switch between pages for certain users depending on their ingestion data. This could result in not being able to properly change pages in the ingestion page.
  - [Remote Automations] Remote Automations runners are encountering a dependency resolution issue when attempting to install `acryl-datahub`. Remote automations are not supported in this release. If you are interested to run automations on your Remote Executor please reach out to DataHub Cloud support.

- Breaking Changes

  - [API] API validation is executed for all ASYNC ingestion requests. This includes URN, Entity Type Names, Entity & Aspect names. This may result in 4xx exceptions when these rules
    are violated.

- Bug Fixes

  - [Schema Tab] Render rich text in the V1 experience where you can click on links instead of having to click "View more"
  - [Subscriptions] Fix edge case where we were not showing display names for users or groups properly in subscription summaries
  - [Nav Bar] Fix the styling of the logo in the new nav bar header experience in Safari
  - [Group Membership] Harden the UI to prevent errors when showing group memberships on a user profile page
  - [Structured Properties] Allow users to search for Glossary Nodes when applying asset values to structured properties
  - [Lineage] Hide a few unwanted and unneeded filters in the lineage list view from the UI
  - [Lineage] Remove restriction on per-hop node limit, causing some results to be hidden.
  - [Lineage] Fix an issue where indirect upstream lineage was incomplete for certain entity types like Charts. Both Impact Analysis & Lineage Graph. This was also causing Upstream Health sidebar section to underreport upstream assets with health problems.
  - [Queries Tab] Change the page size
  - [Search Filters] Adding support for a "Has Siblings" filter (disabled by default, available by request).
