### v0.3.10

- All changes in https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/releases/tag/v1.0.0

- Breaking Changes

- Bug Fixes
  - [Schema Tab] Render rich text in the V1 experience where you can click on links instead of having to click "View more"
  - [Subscriptions] Fix edge case where we were not showing display names for users or groups properly in subscription summaries
  - [Nav Bar] Fix the styling of the logo in the new nav bar header experience in Safari
  - [Group Membership] Harden the UI to prevent errors when showing group memberships on a user profile page
  - [Structured Properties] Allow users to search for Glossary Nodes when applying asset values to structured properties
  - [Lineage] Hide a few unwanted and unneeded filters in the lineage list view from the UI

- Product

  - Our new simplified nav bar is now switched on by default in the V2 UI
  - Links in the documentation tab are now fully editable and can be displayed in page headers and search results. We've also added an `upsertLink` GraphQL endpoint for easier programmatic management of links.
  - Entity profile pages now display the new proposal types: Ownership, Domains, and Structured Properties.
  - Our redesigned proposals experience (Proposals 2.0) is now in beta! Try out the improved interface for viewing proposals you can approve/decline as well as those that you've created.
  - **Proposal Notifications**: You can now configure to be notified when you are assigned to review a proposal, or a proposal you raised is approved or denied from **Settings** > **My Notifications**.
  - **Observe**: Introducing on-demand smart assertions! This means you can create freshness, volume, and field metric anomaly detection checks on-demand, for any table that's supported by Observe.
  - **Observe**: Smart assertion tuning - Improve your anomaly monitors by adjusting training data lookback window, tightening or loosening the sensitivity, and adding data-point exclusion windows.
  - **Observe**: Incidents V2 - Incidents have received a significant uplift! With capabilities to set assignees, severity, stage, and impacted assets. Also: search, group & filter incidents on the incidents tab. 

- Platform
  - OpenAPI: API Tracing improvements (Experimental)
  - Graphql: Sorting added to `scrollAcrossEntities`
  - Performance: Improved access policy performance when using nested domains and containers
  - OpenAPI: Operation endpoints created to fetch raw ES documents and view kafka lag on MCP and MCL topics
  - OpenAPI: Additional validation for URNs and entity/aspect names when using async endpoints
  - OpenAPI: Fixed timeseries aspect ingestion bug #12912
  - RestoreIndices: Support added for read-only replicas

- Ingestion 
  - MLflow: Support dataset ↔ run lineage with customizable platform mapping for datasets.
  - OpenAPI: Ingestion can use OpenAPI instead of Rest.li, set environment variable `DATAHUB_REST_SINK_DEFAULT_ENDPOINT=OPENAPI`
  - API Tracing: Ingestion can trace each async write by tracking the write to primary and search storage, set environment variable `DATAHUB_REST_TRACE_MODE=ENABLED`

- Remote Executor
    - Introduces a new **Executors** tab in the **Manage Data Sources** page for improved management and observability of Remote Executor Pools
    - Create and provision new Executor Pools directly from the UI and optionally set them as default for future Ingestion Source configurations
    - For each Executor Pool, easily view the set of deployed executors, their status, configured Ingestion Sources, and current running tasks
    - New Ingestion Sources will be assigned to the configured default Executor Pool; optionally choose an alternate Pool during Source creation
    - From the Ingestion Sources tab, view at a glance which Executor Pool each Source is configured to use
