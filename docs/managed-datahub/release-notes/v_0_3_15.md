## Release Changelog

### v0.3.15-acryl

New Features:

- **Asset Docs File Upload**: You can now upload files directly to asset and schema field documentation! This feature, currently in private beta, supports images, PDFs, CSVs, and more, allowing you to consolidate all your information in one place — in DataHub!
- **Platforms Home Page Module**: A new Platforms module is now available for your homepage, allowing you to highlight the different platforms represented in your DataHub instance.
- **Structured Property Settings**: You can now hide structured properties from your asset sidebar when no value is set. This lets you highlight important properties while minimizing noise by hiding unset ones.
- Moved logical models OpenAPI APIs to their own controller at `/v3/logical/` and added bulk DELETE endpoint

- **SQL Anomaly Detection**: Detect Anomalies on the return value of custom SQL assertions

Fixes:

- **Quality Tab Performance** - Page performance when loading hundreds of assertions is significantly improved with this release
- **Hierarchy Module Auth Fix** - Previously if a user was not able to view a Domain in a hierarchy module, we would not show anything. Now we always return the Domains in this module that a user is authorized to see as expected.
- **Domains & Glossary Names Truncation** - Previously, if someone opened up the asset sidebar and that caused the name of a Domain or Glossary entity, we would show the truncated name with "..." and if they closed the sidebar the name would remain truncated. This odd UI bug should now be resolved.

## Known Issues

- **executor-coordinator backwards compatibility:** TODO: @Anton @Sergio please describe
- PATCH of the Ownership aspect does not support assigning the same owner to multiple ownership type urns
