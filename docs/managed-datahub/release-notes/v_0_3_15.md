## Release Changelog

### v0.3.15-acryl

New Features:

- **Asset Docs File Upload**: You can now upload files directly to asset and schema field documentation! This feature, currently in private beta, supports images, PDFs, CSVs, and more, allowing you to consolidate all your information in one place — in DataHub!
- **Platforms Home Page Module**: A new Platforms module is now available for your homepage, allowing you to highlight the different platforms represented in your DataHub instance.
- **Structured Property Settings**: You can now hide structured properties from your asset sidebar when no value is set. This lets you highlight important properties while minimizing noise by hiding unset ones.
- Moved logical models OpenAPI APIs to their own controller at `/v3/logical/` and added bulk DELETE endpoint
- **Bulk Un-Mark Anomalies**: Unmark several anomalies in one go via the 'Tune predictions' modal
- **SQL expressions for Column validity assertions**: Validate columns against reference tables with SQL expressions.
- **SQL Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies on the return value of your SQL assertions. This feature requires seven days of training data and cannot be bootstrapped from historical results.
- **Bulk Subscription Management**: Manage all of your and your groups' subscriptions in the new subscription dashboard. You can search and filter through your subscriptions, and bulk edit or delete them.

Fixes:

- **Quality Tab Performance** - Page performance when loading hundreds of assertions is significantly improved with this release
- **Hierarchy Module Auth Fix** - Previously if a user was not able to view a Domain in a hierarchy module, we would not show anything. Now we always return the Domains in this module that a user is authorized to see as expected.
- **Domains & Glossary Names Truncation** - Previously, if someone opened up the asset sidebar and that caused the name of a Domain or Glossary entity, we would show the truncated name with "..." and if they closed the sidebar the name would remain truncated. This odd UI bug should now be resolved.
- **Ask DataHub Settings Refresh** - Previously, restart of integrations service pod was required for enable/disable change for Ask DataHub (@DataHub) settings to take effect. Now, the settings are auto-refreshed every 5 minutes.

## Known Issues

- **executor-coordinator backwards compatibility:** TODO: @Anton @Sergio please describe
- PATCH of the Ownership aspect does not support assigning the same owner to multiple ownership type urns
- If you were to upgrade to v0.3.15 and create a "Platforms" home page module, in order to roll back to a previous version of DataHub you will need to either (1) remove the Platforms modules from all home page templates or (2) roll back to v0.3.14.2 which includes a fix to handle unknown module types. This sort of backwards compatibility with home page modules is resolved going forward with v0.3.15.
