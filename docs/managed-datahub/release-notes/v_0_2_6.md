Recommended CLI
---
- `v0.10.1.2` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.10.1.2
- There is a newer CLI available https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.10.2.2 currently but we do not recommend using that because of a Regression in Redshift connector. If you are not using Redshift connector then you can use the newer CLI version.
