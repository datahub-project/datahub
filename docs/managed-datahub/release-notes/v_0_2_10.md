# v0.2.10

---

## Release Availability Date

09-Aug-2023

## Recommended CLI/SDK

- `v0.10.5.5` with release notes at https://github.com/acryldata/datahub/releases/tag/v0.10.5.5

If you are using an older CLI/SDK version then please upgrade it. This applies for all CLI/SDK usages, if you are using it through your terminal, github actions, airflow, in python SDK somewhere, Java SKD etc. This is a strong recommendation to upgrade as we keep on pushing fixes in the CLI and it helps us support you better.

Special Notes

- We have a new search and browse experience. We cannot enable it unless all of your CLI/SDK usages are upgraded. If you are using a custom source then you need to upgrade your source to produce `browsePathv2` aspects. Details are in [this doc](../../browseV2/browse-paths-v2.md).
- [Breaking change] For all sql-based sources that support profiling, you can no longer specify `profile_table_level_only` together with `include_field_xyz` config options to ingest certain column-level metrics. Instead, set `profile_table_level_only` to false and individually enable / disable desired field metrics.
- [Breaking change] The `bigquery-beta` and `snowflake-beta` source aliases have been dropped. Use `bigquery` and `snowflake` as the source type instead.
- [Behaviour change] Ingestion runs created with Pipeline.create will show up in the DataHub ingestion tab as CLI-based runs. To revert to the previous behavior of not showing these runs in DataHub, pass `no_default_report=True`.
- [Behaviour change] snowflake connector will use user's email attribute as is, as the urn. To revert to previous behavior disable `email_as_user_identifier` in recipe.
