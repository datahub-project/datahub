## Release Changelog

### v0.3.12

This release includes all changes up to and including DataHub Core v1.2.0.

- Breaking Changes

  - All DataHub Python packages now require Python 3.9+. This affects the following packages:
    - `acryl-datahub` (DataHub CLI and SDK)
    - `acryl-datahub-actions`
    - `acryl-datahub-airflow-plugin`
    - `acryl-datahub-prefect-plugin`
    - `acryl-datahub-gx-plugin`
    - `acryl-datahub-dagster-plugin` (already required Python 3.9+)
  - #13619: The `acryl-datahub-airflow-plugin` has dropped support for Airflow versions less than 2.7.
  - #14054: The v1 plugin in `acryl-datahub-airflow-plugin` has been removed. The v2 plugin has been the default for a while already, so this should not impact most users. Users who were explicitly setting `DATAHUB_AIRFLOW_PLUGIN_USE_V1_PLUGIN=true` will need to either upgrade or pin to an older version to continue using the v1 plugin.
  - #14015: In the sql-queries source, the `default_dialect` configuration parameter has been renamed to `override_dialect`. This also affects the Python SDK methods:
    - `DataHubGraph.parse_sql_lineage(default_dialect=...)` → `DataHubGraph.parse_sql_lineage(override_dialect=...)`
    - `LineageClient.add_lineage_via_sql(default_dialect=...)` → `LineageClient.add_lineage_via_sql(override_dialect=...)`
  - #14059: The `acryl-datahub-gx-plugin` now requires pydantic v2, which means the effective minimum supported version of GX is 0.17.15 (from Sept 2023).
  - #13601: The `use_queries_v2` flag is now enabled by default for Snowflake and BigQuery ingestion. This improves the quality of lineage and quantity of queries extracted.

  - Search Filters - Allow searching for values on structured property filters outside of the initial set of provided values from the server. The limitation here is that your search must include the full value you are looking for in order to filter on it.
