## Update Downtime

During release installation the Elasticsearch indices will be reindex to improve search capabilities. While the upgrade is in progress
DataHub will be set to a read-only mode. Once this operation is completed, the upgrade will proceed normally. Depending on index sizes and
infrastructure this process can take 5 minutes to hours however as a rough estimate 1 hour for every 2.3 million entities.
