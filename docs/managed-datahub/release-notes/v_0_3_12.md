# v0.3.12

## Release Availability Date

18-Jun-2025

## Recommended CLI/SDK

1.1.0.2

## Recommended Remote Executor

v0.3.12-acryl (recommended) / v0.3.11.1-acryl (minimum)

## Known Issues

- Remote executor versions older than `v0.3.11.1-acryl` will not work with this release. If you're on an older version, please reach out to your DataHub representative - there may be some workarounds.
- There are two issues with the remote executor that the DataHub team is triaging: (1) for system ingestion sources, sometimes they do not get executed as expected if their schedule is repeatedly changed and (2) in rare cases, the remote executor may stop responding to new requests. In both cases, restarting the remote executor resolves the issue.
- The "remote automations" feature does not yet work. Automations must run with the default "DataHub embedded" executor. Note that remote automations is a specific capability of the remote executor; remote ingestion and observability are not affected.
