- Since `v0.2.0` these changes from OSS DataHub https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/compare/cf1e627e55431fc69d72918b2bcc3c5f3a1d5002...36037cf288eea12f1760dd0718255eeb1d7039c7 have been pulled in.
- Add first, last synched + last updated properties to metadata tests.
- Update link colors to pass accessibility.
- Extend tag and term proposals to other entity types besides datasets. This allows proposals to work on entities other than datasets.
- We are skipping running metadata tests in real-time processing as it was not scaling out and causing issues in ingestion
- Re-enabling hard-deletes which was temporarily disabled
