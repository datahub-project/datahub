## SCIM Integration: MS Entra and DataHub

<FeatureAvailability saasOnly />

## Overview

On completion of this setup the MS Entra will automatically manage the groups/users/roles from MS Entra to DataHub.

Consider following configuration in MS Entra

- A group `governance-team` group
- And it has two memeber `john` and `sid`
- And the group has role `Reader`

If you configure the `governance-team` for auto provisioning, MS Entra will creates the `governance-team` group and it's member automatically on DataHub and set the `Reader` roles on users.

If you remove `john` from group `governance-team` then MS Entra will automatically removes the `john` from DataHub's `governance-team` group.

If you permanently deletes a user or group from MS Entra then MS Entra will automatically deletes the user or group from the DataHub.

> MS Entra doesn't send the user's password on user creation and hence DataHub Admin need to reset their password to be able to login into the DataHub.

> Only Admin, Editor and Reader roles are supported in DataHub. These roles are preconfigured/created on DataHub
