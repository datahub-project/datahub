# DataHub Town Halls

We hold virtual Town Hall meetings with the DataHub Community every month (with some exceptions due to holidays).

It's a great opportunity for the Community to come together to discuss project and roadmap updates, see live demos of upcoming features, and hear case studies from other Community Members.
