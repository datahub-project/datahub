With AI-powered documentation, you can automatically generate documentation for tables and columns.

## Configuring

Ensure you have edit dataset description privileges.

Once permissions are obtained, no configuration is required - just hit "Generate" on any table or column in the UI.

## How it works

Generating good documentation requires a holistic understanding of the data. Information we take into account includes, but is not limited to:

- Dataset name and any existing documentation
- Column name, type, description, and sample values
- Lineage relationships to upstream and downstream assets
- Metadata about other related assets

Data privacy: Your metadata is not sent to any third-party LLMs. We use AWS Bedrock internally, which means all metadata remains within the DataHub Cloud AWS account. We do not fine-tune on customer data.

## Limitations

- This feature is not available on tables with more than 100 columns. We are working on expanding this limit.
- This feature is powered by an LLM, which can produce inaccurate results. While we've taken steps to reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, they can still occur.
