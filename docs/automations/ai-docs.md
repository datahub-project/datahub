# AI Documentation

<FeatureAvailability saasOnly />

With AI-powered documentation, you can automatically generate documentation for tables and columns.

## Prerequisites

As of DataHub Cloud v0.3.12, AI documentation is in public beta. Admins (or users with the "Manage Platform Settings" privilege) can enable it from settings.

## Usage

Ensure you have permissions to edit the dataset description. No other configuration is required - just hit "Generate" on any table or column in the UI.

All AI-generated documentation that has not been reviewed by a human will be marked as such with the sparkle icon.

## How it works

Generating good documentation requires a holistic understanding of the data. Information we take into account includes, but is not limited to:

- Dataset name and any existing documentation
- Column name, type, description, and sample values
- Lineage relationships to upstream and downstream assets
- Metadata about other related assets

Data privacy: Your metadata is not sent to any third-party LLMs. We use AWS Bedrock internally, which means all metadata remains within the DataHub Cloud AWS account. We do not fine-tune on customer data.

## Limitations

- AI documentation is not available for tables with more than 1000 columns (prior to v0.3.12, this limit was 100 columns).
- This feature is powered by LLMs, which can produce inaccurate results. While we've taken steps to reduce the likelihood of hallucinations, they may still occur.
