# Container

The container entity is a core entity in the metadata model that represents a grouping of related data assets. Containers provide hierarchical organization for datasets, charts, dashboards, and other containers, enabling navigation and structure discovery within data platforms.

## Identity

Containers are uniquely identified by a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) that is typically derived from a combination of attributes specific to the container type. Unlike datasets which use platform, name, and environment, containers use a more flexible identification scheme based on their hierarchical properties.

The URN structure for a container is: `urn:li:container:{guid}`

The GUID is typically computed from container-specific properties such as:

- **Database containers**: platform + instance + database name
- **Schema containers**: platform + instance + database + schema name
- **Project containers**: platform + instance + project_id
- **Folder containers**: platform + instance + folder_abs_path
- **Bucket containers**: platform + instance + bucket_name

### URN Examples

```
urn:li:container:b5e95fce839e7d78151ed7e0a7420d84
```

The GUID is generated using the `datahub_guid()` function from a dictionary of properties. For example, a Snowflake schema container would be identified by:

```python
{
  "platform": "snowflake",
  "instance": "prod_instance",
  "database": "analytics",
  "schema": "reporting"
}
```

## Real-World Concepts

Containers represent various hierarchical structures in data platforms:

- **Databases**: Top-level organizational units in relational systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Snowflake)
- **Schemas**: Logical groupings within databases (Snowflake schemas, PostgreSQL schemas)
- **Projects**: Organizational units in cloud platforms (BigQuery projects)
- **Datasets**: Logical groupings in cloud platforms (BigQuery datasets)
- **Folders**: Directory structures in file systems and data lakes (S3 folders, ADLS directories)
- **Buckets**: Top-level storage containers in cloud object stores (S3 buckets, GCS buckets)
- **Workspaces**: Organizational units in BI platforms (Power BI workspaces, Tableau sites)
- **Catalogs**: Top-level organizational units in data catalogs (Unity Catalog, Iceberg catalogs)
- **Metastores**: Storage metadata repositories (Hive metastore, Unity metastore)

## Important Capabilities

### Container Properties

The `containerProperties` aspect contains metadata inherited from the source system:

- **name**: Display name of the container (required)
- **qualifiedName**: Fully-qualified name (optional, e.g., "prod.analytics.reporting")
- **description**: Description from the source system
- **env**: Environment indicator (PROD, DEV, QA, etc.)
- **customProperties**: Additional key-value properties from the source system
- **externalUrl**: Link to the container in the source system
- **created**: Timestamp when the container was created in the source system
- **lastModified**: Timestamp when the container was last modified in the source system

### Editable Container Properties

The `editableContainerProperties` aspect allows users to override or add information via the UI:

- **description**: User-provided description that supplements or overrides the source system description

This separation ensures that metadata from source systems doesn't conflict with user-provided annotations.

### Hierarchical Relationships

Containers support nested hierarchies through the `container` aspect, which links a container to its parent container. This enables multi-level organizational structures:

```
Platform (implicit)
└── Database Container
    └── Schema Container
        └── Dataset
```

For example, in Snowflake:

```
Snowflake Platform
└── ANALYTICS_DB (Database Container)
    └── REPORTING (Schema Container)
        └── SALES_METRICS (Dataset)
        └── REVENUE_TABLE (Dataset)
```

### Subtypes

The `subTypes` aspect specifies the type of container, which helps the UI render appropriate icons and behaviors. Common subtypes include:

- **Database**: Relational database containers
- **Schema**: Schema-level containers within databases
- **Project**: Cloud project containers (GCP, Azure)
- **Dataset**: BigQuery dataset containers
- **Folder**: File system folders
- **Bucket**: Object storage buckets
- **Workspace**: BI platform workspaces
- **Catalog**: Data catalog containers
- **Metastore**: Metadata storage containers
- **MLflow Experiment** (`MLAssetSubTypes.MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT`): ML experiment containers that organize training runs

### ML Experiments as Containers

Machine learning experiments are modeled as containers with the `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT` subtype. This pattern enables organizing related training runs (which are `dataProcessInstance` entities) into logical groups for comparison and tracking:

```
ML Experiment (Container)
├── Training Run 1 (DataProcessInstance)
├── Training Run 2 (DataProcessInstance)
└── Training Run 3 (DataProcessInstance)
```

Training runs belong to experiments through the `container` aspect. This structure mirrors common ML platform patterns (like MLflow) and enables:

- Comparing metrics across multiple training attempts
- Tracking the evolution of a model through iterations
- Organizing training work by project or objective

For more information on ML experiments and training runs, see:

- [ML Model entity documentation](mlModel.md#training-runs-and-experiments)
- [DataProcessInstance documentation for training runs](dataProcessInstance.md#tracking-ml-training-run-in-a-container)

### Containable Entities

The following entity types can be contained within a container:

- Datasets
- Charts
- Dashboards
- DataProcessInstances (e.g., training runs in ML experiments)
- Other Containers (for nested hierarchies)

## Code Examples

### Create a Database Container


**Python SDK: Create a database container**

```python
# Inlined from /metadata-ingestion/examples/library/container_create_database.py
# metadata-ingestion/examples/library/container_create_database.py
from datahub.emitter.mcp_builder import DatabaseKey
from datahub.sdk import Container, DataHubClient

client = DataHubClient.from_env()

container = Container(
    container_key=DatabaseKey(
        platform="snowflake",
        instance="production",
        database="analytics_db",
    ),
    display_name="Analytics Database",
    description="Main analytics database containing reporting and metrics data",
    subtype="Database",
    external_url="https://app.snowflake.com/analytics_db",
    parent_container=None,
)

client.entities.upsert(container)

print(f"Created database container with URN: {container.urn}")

```



### Create a Schema Container with Parent


**Python SDK: Create a schema container with parent database**

```python
# Inlined from /metadata-ingestion/examples/library/container_create_schema.py
# metadata-ingestion/examples/library/container_create_schema.py
from datahub.emitter.mcp_builder import DatabaseKey, SchemaKey
from datahub.sdk import Container, DataHubClient

client = DataHubClient.from_env()

# First, create the database container
database_key = DatabaseKey(
    platform="snowflake",
    instance="production",
    database="analytics_db",
)

database_container = Container(
    container_key=database_key,
    display_name="Analytics Database",
    description="Main analytics database",
    subtype="Database",
)

client.entities.upsert(database_container)
print(f"Created database container: {database_container.urn}")

# Create a schema container within the database
schema_key = SchemaKey(
    platform="snowflake",
    instance="production",
    database="analytics_db",
    schema="reporting",
)

schema_container = Container(
    container_key=schema_key,
    display_name="Reporting Schema",
    description="Schema containing all reporting tables and views",
    subtype="Schema",
)

client.entities.upsert(schema_container)
print(f"Created schema container: {schema_container.urn}")
print("Schema container is nested under database container")

```



### Add Metadata to a Container


**Python SDK: Add tags, terms, and ownership to a container**

```python
# Inlined from /metadata-ingestion/examples/library/container_add_metadata.py
from datahub.emitter.mcp_builder import DatabaseKey
from datahub.sdk import ContainerUrn, CorpUserUrn, DataHubClient, DomainUrn, TagUrn

client = DataHubClient.from_env()

database_key = DatabaseKey(
    platform="snowflake",
    instance="production",
    database="analytics_db",
)

container = client.entities.get(ContainerUrn.from_string(database_key.as_urn()))

container.set_display_name("Analytics Database")
container.set_description(
    "Main analytics database containing reporting and metrics data"
)
container.set_subtype("Database")
container.set_external_url("https://app.snowflake.com/analytics_db")

container.set_tags([TagUrn("production"), TagUrn("analytics"), TagUrn("pii")])

container.set_terms(["urn:li:glossaryTerm:Finance.ReportingData"])

container.set_owners(
    [
        (CorpUserUrn("john.doe"), "DATAOWNER"),
        (CorpUserUrn("analytics-team"), "TECHNICAL_OWNER"),
    ]
)

container.set_domain(DomainUrn("Analytics"))

container.set_links(
    [
        (
            "https://wiki.company.com/analytics-db",
            "Database Documentation",
        ),
        (
            "https://jira.company.com/ANALYTICS-123",
            "Setup Ticket",
        ),
    ]
)

client.entities.update(container)

print(f"Updated container with comprehensive metadata: {container.urn}")
print(f"  - Tags: {len(container.tags or [])} tags")
print(f"  - Terms: {len(container.terms or [])} terms")
print(f"  - Owners: {len(container.owners or [])} owners")
print(f"  - Links: {len(container.links or [])} links")
print(f"  - Domain: {container.domain}")

```



### Query Container via REST API

Containers can be retrieved using the standard entity retrieval APIs:


**Fetch container entity including all aspects**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/entities/urn%3Ali%3Acontainer%3Ab5e95fce839e7d78151ed7e0a7420d84'
```

The response will include all aspects associated with the container, including properties, ownership, tags, terms, etc.



To find all entities within a container, use the relationships API:


**Find all entities contained within a container**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/relationships?direction=INCOMING&urn=urn%3Ali%3Acontainer%3Ab5e95fce839e7d78151ed7e0a7420d84&types=IsPartOf'
```

This returns all entities (datasets, charts, dashboards, sub-containers) that have this container as their parent.



## Integration Points

### Relationship with Datasets

Datasets are the most common entities contained within containers. The relationship is established through the `container` aspect on the dataset, which points to the container URN.

```python
# Dataset links to its parent container (schema)
dataset = Dataset(
    platform="snowflake",
    name="analytics_db.reporting.sales_table",
    env="PROD",
    parent_container=schema_key,  # Links to schema container
)
```

### Hierarchical Navigation

Containers enable hierarchical navigation in the DataHub UI through parent-child relationships:

1. **Top-down browsing**: Users can navigate from databases to schemas to tables
2. **Bottom-up breadcrumbs**: Datasets show their parent containers in breadcrumb trails
3. **Browse paths**: Containers are used to generate browse paths automatically

### GraphQL Resolvers

The container entity has specialized GraphQL resolvers:

- **ContainerEntitiesResolver**: Retrieves all entities (datasets, charts, dashboards, sub-containers) within a container
- **ParentContainersResolver**: Retrieves the full hierarchy of parent containers for any entity

These resolvers power the UI's hierarchical navigation and container overview pages.

### Common Usage Patterns

1. **Database/Schema Hierarchy**: Relational databases use Database and Schema containers
2. **Project/Dataset Hierarchy**: BigQuery uses Project and Dataset containers
3. **Workspace/Folder Hierarchy**: BI tools use Workspace containers for organization
4. **Bucket/Folder Hierarchy**: Data lakes use Bucket and Folder containers
5. **Catalog/Schema Hierarchy**: Modern catalogs (Unity, Iceberg) use Catalog and Schema containers

## Notable Exceptions

### GUID Stability

Container GUIDs must remain stable across ingestion runs. Since containers are identified by GUID rather than explicit properties in the URN, changing the GUID computation will create a new container entity instead of updating the existing one.

When creating custom containers, ensure that the properties used to generate the GUID are:

- Stable across time
- Unique within the platform
- Derived from immutable source system identifiers

### Self-Referential Containers

While containers can contain other containers, be careful not to create circular references. The parent-child relationship should form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), not a cycle.

### Environment Handling

The `env` field in ContainerKey has special handling for backwards compatibility. In some sources, the platform instance was incorrectly set to the environment value. The `backcompat_env_as_instance` flag handles this case.

When using the `env` field:

- Set it to a valid FabricType (PROD, DEV, QA, etc.)
- Don't use it for platform instance identification
- Use the separate `instance` field for multi-instance deployments

### Platform Instance Association

Unlike datasets which embed platform instance in their URN, containers associate platform instances through the `dataPlatformInstance` aspect. This allows containers to be associated with specific instances of a data platform while maintaining a stable GUID.

### Access Control

Containers support the `access` aspect, which can be used to model access control policies at the container level. This is particularly useful for:

- Database-level permissions
- Schema-level access control
- Project-level authorization
- Workspace-level security

Access controls set on containers can be inherited by contained entities, though this behavior depends on the specific platform's implementation.



## Technical Reference Guide

The sections above provide an overview of how to use this entity. The following sections provide detailed technical information about how metadata is stored and represented in DataHub.

**Aspects** are the individual pieces of metadata that can be attached to an entity. Each aspect contains specific information (like ownership, tags, or properties) and is stored as a separate record, allowing for flexible and incremental metadata updates.

**Relationships** show how this entity connects to other entities in the metadata graph. These connections are derived from the fields within each aspect and form the foundation of DataHub's knowledge graph.

### Reading the Field Tables

Each aspect's field table includes an **Annotations** column that provides additional metadata about how fields are used:

- **⚠️ Deprecated**: This field is deprecated and may be removed in a future version. Check the description for the recommended alternative
- **Searchable**: This field is indexed and can be searched in DataHub's search interface
- **Searchable (fieldname)**: When the field name in parentheses is shown, it indicates the field is indexed under a different name in the search index. For example, `dashboardTool` is indexed as `tool`
- **→ RelationshipName**: This field creates a relationship to another entity. The arrow indicates this field contains a reference (URN) to another entity, and the name indicates the type of relationship (e.g., `→ Contains`, `→ OwnedBy`)

Fields with complex types (like `Edge`, `AuditStamp`) link to their definitions in the [Common Types](#common-types) section below.

#### documentation
Aspect used for storing all applicable documentations on assets.
This aspect supports multiple documentations from different sources.
There is an implicit assumption that there is only one documentation per
   source.
For example, if there are two documentations from the same source, the
   latest one will overwrite the previous one.
If there are two documentations from different sources, both will be
   stored.
Future evolution considerations:
The first entity that uses this aspect is Schema Field. We will expand this
    aspect to other entities eventually.
The values of the documentation are not currently searchable. This will be
    changed once this aspect develops opinion on which documentation entry is
    the authoritative one.
Ensuring that there is only one documentation per source is a business
    rule that is not enforced by the aspect yet. This will currently be enforced by the
    application that uses this aspect. We will eventually enforce this rule in
    the aspect using AspectMutators.



#### Fields



| Field | Type | Required | Description | Annotations |
