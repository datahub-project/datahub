# Concepts & Key Components

We introduced a few important concepts to the Metadata Service to make authentication work:

1. Actor
2. Authenticator
3. AuthenticatorChain
4. AuthenticationFilter
5. DataHub Access Token
6. DataHub Token Service

In following sections, we'll take a closer look at each individually.

_High level overview of Metadata Service Authentication_

## What is an Actor?

An **Actor** is a concept within the new Authentication subsystem to represent a unique identity / principal that is initiating actions (e.g. read & write requests)
on the platform.

An actor can be characterized by 2 attributes:

1. **Type**: The "type" of the actor making a request. The purpose is to for example distinguish between a "user" & "service" actor. Currently, the "user" actor type is the only one
   formally supported.
2. **Id**: A unique identifier for the actor within DataHub. This is commonly known as a "principal" in other systems. In the case of users, this
   represents a unique "username". This username is in turn used when converting from the "Actor" concept into a Metadata Entity Urn (e.g. CorpUserUrn).

For example, the root "datahub" super user would have the following attributes:

```
{
   "type": "USER",
   "id": "datahub"
}
```

Which is mapped to the CorpUser urn:

```
urn:li:corpuser:datahub
```

for Metadata retrieval.

## What is an Authenticator?

An **Authenticator** is a pluggable component inside the Metadata Service that is responsible for authenticating an inbound request provided context about the request (currently, the request headers).
Authentication boils down to successfully resolving an **Actor** to associate with the inbound request.

There can be many types of Authenticator. For example, there can be Authenticators that

- Verify the authenticity of access tokens (ie. issued by either DataHub itself or a 3rd-party IdP)
- Authenticate username / password credentials against a remote database (ie. LDAP)

and more! A key goal of the abstraction is _extensibility_: a custom Authenticator can be developed to authenticate requests
based on an organization's unique needs.

DataHub ships with 3 Authenticators by default:

- **DataHubSystemAuthenticator**: Verifies that inbound requests have originated from inside DataHub itself using a shared system identifier
  and secret. This authenticator is always present.

- **DataHubTokenAuthenticator**: Verifies that inbound requests contain a DataHub-issued Access Token (discussed further in the "DataHub Access Token" section below) in their
  'Authorization' header. This authenticator is required if Metadata Service Authentication is enabled.

- **DataHubGuestAuthenticator**: Verifies if guest authentication is enabled with a guest user configured and allows unauthenticated users to perform operations as the designated
  guest user. By default, this Authenticator is disabled. If this is required, it needs to be explicitly enabled and requires a restart of the datahub GMS service.
-

## What is an AuthenticatorChain?

An **AuthenticatorChain** is a series of **Authenticators** that are configured to run one-after-another. This allows
for configuring multiple ways to authenticate a given request, for example via LDAP OR via local key file.

Only if each Authenticator within the chain fails to authenticate a request will it be rejected.

The Authenticator Chain can be configured in the `application.yaml` file under `authentication.authenticators`:

```
authentication:
  ....
  authenticators:
    # Configure the Authenticators in the chain
    - type: com.datahub.authentication.Authenticator1
      ...
    - type: com.datahub.authentication.Authenticator2
    ....
```

## What is the AuthenticationFilter?

The **AuthenticationFilter** is a [servlet filter](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-servlets/servlet-filters.html) that authenticates each and requests to the Metadata Service.
It does so by constructing and invoking an **AuthenticatorChain**, described above.

If an Actor is unable to be resolved by the AuthenticatorChain, then a 401 unauthorized exception will be returned by the filter.

## What is a DataHub Token Service? What are Access Tokens?

Along with Metadata Service Authentication comes an important new component called the **DataHub Token Service**. The purpose of this
component is twofold:

1. Generate Access Tokens that grant access to the Metadata Service
2. Verify the validity of Access Tokens presented to the Metadata Service

**Access Tokens** granted by the Token Service take the form of [Json Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction), a type of stateless token which
has a finite lifespan & is verified using a unique signature. JWTs can also contain a set of claims embedded within them. Tokens issued by the Token
Service contain the following claims:

- exp: the expiration time of the token
- version: version of the DataHub Access Token for purposes of evolvability (currently 1)
- type: The type of token, currently SESSION (used for UI-based sessions) or PERSONAL (used for personal access tokens)
- actorType: The type of the **Actor** associated with the token. Currently, USER is the only type supported.
- actorId: The id of the **Actor** associated with the token.

Today, Access Tokens are granted by the Token Service under two scenarios:

1. **UI Login**: When a user logs into the DataHub UI, for example via [JaaS](guides/jaas.md) or
   [OIDC](guides/sso/configure-oidc-react.md), the `datahub-frontend` service issues an
   request to the Metadata Service to generate a SESSION token _on behalf of_ of the user logging in. (\*Only the frontend service is authorized to perform this action).
2. **Generating Personal Access Tokens**: When a user requests to generate a Personal Access Token (described below) from the UI.

> At present, the Token Service supports the symmetric signing method `HS256` to generate and verify tokens.

Now that we're familiar with the concepts, we will talk concretely about what new capabilities have been built on top
of Metadata Service Authentication.

## How do I enable Guest Authentication

The Guest Authentication configuration is present in two configuration files - the `application.conf` for DataHub frontend, and
`application.yaml` for GMS. To enable Guest Authentication, set the environment variable `GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED` to `true`
for both the GMS and the frontend service and restart those services.
If enabled, the default user designated as guest is called `guest`. This user must be explicitly created and privileges assigned
to control the guest user privileges.

A recommended approach to operationalize guest access is, first, create a designated guest user account with login credentials,
but keep guest access disabled. This allows you to configure and test the exact permissions this user should have. Once you've
confirmed the privileges are set correctly, you can then enable guest access, which removes the need for login/credentials
while maintaining the verified permission settings.

The name of the designated guest user can be changed by defining the env var `GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_USER`.
The entry URL to authenticate as the guest user is `/public` and can be changed via the env var `GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_PATH`

Here are the relevant portions of the two configs

For the Frontend

```yaml
#application.conf
...
auth.guest.enabled = ${?GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED}
# The name of the guest user id
auth.guest.user = ${?GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_USER}
# The path to bypass login page and get logged in as guest
auth.guest.path = ${?GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_PATH}
...
```

and for GMS

```yaml
#application.yaml
# Required if enabled is true! A configurable chain of Authenticators
...
authenticators:
  ...
  - type: com.datahub.authentication.authenticator.DataHubGuestAuthenticator
    configs:
      guestUser: ${GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_USER:guest}
      enabled: ${GUEST_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED:false}
...
```
