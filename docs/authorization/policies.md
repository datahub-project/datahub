# Policies Guide

## Introduction

DataHub provides the ability to declare fine-grained access control Policies via the UI & GraphQL API.
Access policies in DataHub define _who_ can _do what_ to _which resources_. A few policies in plain English include

- Dataset Owners should be allowed to edit documentation, but not Tags.
- Jenny, our Data Steward, should be allowed to edit Tags for any Dashboard, but no other metadata.
- James, a Data Analyst, should be allowed to edit the Links for a specific Data Pipeline he is a downstream consumer of.
- The Data Platform team should be allowed to manage users & groups, view platform analytics, & manage policies themselves.

In this document, we'll take a deeper look at DataHub Policies & how to use them effectively.

## What is a Policy?

There are 2 types of Policy within DataHub:

1. Platform Policies
2. Metadata Policies

We'll briefly describe each.

### Platform Policies

**Platform** policies determine who has platform-level privileges on DataHub. These privileges include

- Managing Users & Groups
- Viewing the DataHub Analytics Page
- Managing Policies themselves

Platform policies can be broken down into 2 parts:

1. **Actors**: Who the policy applies to (Users or Groups)
2. **Privileges**: Which privileges should be assigned to the Actors (e.g. "View Analytics")

Note that platform policies do not include a specific "target resource" against which the Policies apply. Instead,
they simply serve to assign specific privileges to DataHub users and groups.

### Metadata Policies

**Metadata** policies determine who can do what to which Metadata Entities. For example,

- Who can edit Dataset Documentation & Links?
- Who can add Owners to a Chart?
- Who can add Tags to a Dashboard?

and so on.

A Metadata Policy can be broken down into 3 parts:

1. **Resources**: The 'which'. Resources that the policy applies to, e.g. "All Datasets".
2. **Privileges**: The 'what'. What actions are being permitted by a policy, e.g. "Add Tags".
3. **Actors**: The 'who'. Specific users, groups that the policy applies to.

#### Resources

Resources can be associated with the policy in a number of ways.

1. List of resource types - The entity's type for example: dataset, chart, dashboard
2. List of resource URNs
3. List of tags
4. List of domains

:::note Important Note
The associations in the list above are an _intersection_ or an _AND_ operation. For example, if the policy targets
`1. resource type: dataset` and `3. resources tagged: 'myTag'`, it will apply to datasets that are tagged with tag 'myTag'.
:::

#### Privileges

Check out the list of
privileges [here](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/blob/master/metadata-utils/src/main/java/com/linkedin/metadata/authorization/PoliciesConfig.java)
. Note, the privileges are semantic by nature, and does not tie in 1-to-1 with the aspect model.

All edits on the UI are covered by a privilege, to make sure we have the ability to restrict write access. See the
[Reference](#Reference) section below.

#### Actors

We currently support 3 ways to define the set of actors the policy applies to:

1. list of users (or all users)
2. list of groups (or all groups)
3. owners of the entity

:::note Important Note
Unlike resources, the definitions for actors are a union of the actors. For example, if user `1. Alice` is associated
with the policy as well as `3. owners of the entity`. This means that Alice _OR_ any owner of
the targeted resource(s) will be included in the policy.
:::

## Managing Policies

Policies can be managed on the page **Settings > Permissions > Policies** page. The `Policies` tab will only
be visible to those users having the `Manage Policies` privilege.

Out of the box, DataHub is deployed with a set of pre-baked Policies. The set of default policies are created at deploy
time and can be found inside the `policies.json` file within `metadata-service/war/src/main/resources/boot`. This set of policies serves the
following purposes:

1. Assigns immutable super-user privileges for the root `datahub` user account (Immutable)
2. Assigns all Platform privileges for all Users by default (Editable)

The reason for #1 is to prevent people from accidentally deleting all policies and getting locked out (`datahub` super user account can be a backup)
The reason for #2 is to permit administrators to log in via OIDC or another means outside of the `datahub` root account
when they are bootstrapping with DataHub. This way, those setting up DataHub can start managing policies without friction.
Note that these privilege _can_ and likely _should_ be altered inside the **Policies** page of the UI.

:::note Pro-Tip
To login using the `datahub` account, simply navigate to `<your-datahub-domain>/login` and enter `datahub`, `datahub`. Note that the password can be customized for your
deployment by changing the `user.props` file within the `datahub-frontend` module. Notice that JaaS authentication must be enabled.
:::note

## Configuration

By default, the Policies feature is _enabled_. This means that the deployment will support creating, editing, removing, and
most importantly enforcing fine-grained access policies.

In some cases, these capabilities are not desirable. For example, if your company's users are already used to having free reign, you
may want to keep it that way. Or perhaps it is only your Data Platform team who actively uses DataHub, in which case Policies may be overkill.

For these scenarios, we've provided a back door to disable Policies in your deployment of DataHub. This will completely hide
the policies management UI and by default will allow all actions on the platform. It will be as though
each user has _all_ privileges, both of the **Platform** & **Metadata** flavor.

To disable Policies, you can simply set the `AUTH_POLICIES_ENABLED` environment variable for the `datahub-gms` service container
to `false`. For example in your `docker/datahub-gms/docker.env`, you'd place

```
AUTH_POLICIES_ENABLED=false
```

### REST API Authorization

Policies only affect REST APIs when the environment variable `REST_API_AUTHORIZATION` is set to `true` for GMS. Some policies only apply when this setting is enabled, marked above, and other Metadata and Platform policies apply to the APIs where relevant, also specified in the table above.

### Platform-level privileges

These privileges are for DataHub operators to access & manage the administrative functionality of the system.

## Coming Soon

The DataHub team is hard at work trying to improve the Policies feature. We are planning on building out the following:

- Hide edit action buttons on Entity pages to reflect user privileges

Under consideration

- Ability to define Metadata Policies against multiple resources scoped to particular "Containers" (e.g. A "schema", "database", or "collection")
