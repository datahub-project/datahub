# Act on Metadata Overview

DataHub's metadata infrastructure is stream-oriented, meaning that all changes in metadata are communicated and reflected within the platform within seconds. 

This unlocks endless opportunities to automate data governance and data management workflows, such as:

* Automatically enrich or annotate existing data entities within DataHub, i.e., apply Tags, Terms, Owners, etc.
* Leverage the [Actions Framework](actions/README.md) to trigger external workflows or send alerts to external systems, i.e., send a message to a team channel when there's a schema change
* Proactively identify what business-critical data resources will be impacted by a breaking schema change

This section contains resources to help you take real-time action on your rapidly evolving data stack.
