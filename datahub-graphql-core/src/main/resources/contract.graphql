A Data Contract Entity. A Data Contract is a verifiable group of assertions regarding various aspects of the data: its freshness (sla),
schema, and data quality or validity. This group of assertions represents a data owner's commitment to producing data that confirms to the agreed
upon contract. Each dataset can have a single contract. The contract can be in a "passing" or "violating" state, depending
on whether the assertions that compose the contract are passing or failing.
Note that the data contract entity is currently in early preview (beta).
