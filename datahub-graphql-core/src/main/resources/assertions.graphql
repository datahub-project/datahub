Core attributes required to identify an incrementing segment in a table. This type is mainly useful
for tables that constantly increase with new rows being added on a particular cadence (e.g. fact or event tables).

An incrementing segment represents a logical chunk of data which is INSERTED
into a dataset on a regular interval, along with the presence of a constantly-incrementing column
value such as an event time, date partition, or last modified column.

An incrementing segment is principally identified by 2 key attributes combined:

1. A field or column that represents the incrementing value. New rows that are inserted will be identified using this column.
   Note that the value of this column may not by itself represent the "bucket" or the "segment" in which the row falls.

2. [Optional] An transformer function that may be applied to the selected column value in order
   to obtain the final "segment identifier" or "bucket identifier". Rows that have the same value after applying the transformation
   will be grouped into the same segment, using which the final value (e.g. row count) will be determined.
