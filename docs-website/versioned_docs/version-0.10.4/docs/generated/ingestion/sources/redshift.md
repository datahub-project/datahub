# Redshift

There are 3 sources that provide integration with Redshift

<table>
<tr><td>Source Module</td><td>Documentation</td></tr><tr>

`redshift`

</td>
<td>

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional SQL profiling
- Table lineage
- Usage statistics

### Prerequisites

This source needs to access system tables that require extra permissions.
To grant these permissions, please alter your datahub Redshift user the following way:

```sql
ALTER USER datahub_user WITH SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svv_table_info to datahub_user;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svl_user_info to datahub_user;
```

:::note

Giving a user unrestricted access to system tables gives the user visibility to data generated by other users. For example, STL_QUERY and STL_QUERYTEXT contain the full text of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

:::

### Lineage

There are multiple lineage collector implementations as Redshift does not support table lineage out of the box.

#### stl_scan_based

The stl_scan based collector uses Redshift's [stl_insert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_INSERT.html) and [stl_scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_SCAN.html) system tables to
discover lineage between tables.
Pros:

- Fast
- Reliable

Cons:

- Does not work with Spectrum/external tables because those scans do not show up in stl_scan table.
- If a table is depending on a view then the view won't be listed as dependency. Instead the table will be connected with the view's dependencies.

#### sql_based

The sql_based based collector uses Redshift's [stl_insert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_INSERT.html) to discover all the insert queries
and uses sql parsing to discover the dependecies.

Pros:

- Works with Spectrum tables
- Views are connected properly if a table depends on it

Cons:

- Slow.
- Less reliable as the query parser can fail on certain queries

#### mixed

Using both collector above and first applying the sql based and then the stl_scan based one.

Pros:

- Works with Spectrum tables
- Views are connected properly if a table depends on it
- A bit more reliable than the sql_based one only

Cons:

- Slow
- May be incorrect at times as the query parser can fail on certain queries

:::note

The redshift stl redshift tables which are used for getting data lineage only retain approximately two to five days of log history. This means you cannot extract lineage from queries issued outside that window.

:::

### Profiling

Profiling runs sql queries on the redshift cluster to get statistics about the tables. To be able to do that, the user needs to have read access to the tables that should be profiled.

If you don't want to grant read access to the tables you can enable table level profiling which will get table statistics without reading the data.

```yaml
profiling:
  profile_table_level_only: true
```

`redshift-legacy`

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Also supports PostGIS extensions
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional SQL profiling
- Table lineage

:::tip

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for Redshift using the `redshift-usage` source described below.

`redshift-usage-legacy`

</td>
<td>

This plugin extracts usage statistics for datasets in Amazon Redshift.

Note: Usage information is computed by querying the following system tables -

1. stl_scan
2. svv_table_info
3. stl_query
4. svl_user_info

To grant access this plugin for all system tables, please alter your datahub Redshift user the following way:

```sql
ALTER USER datahub_user WITH SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED;
```

This plugin has the below functionalities -

1. For a specific dataset this plugin ingests the following statistics -
   1. top n queries.
   2. top users.
2. Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity.

:::note

This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your Redshift warehouse, ingest using the `redshift` source described above.

:::

:::note

Redshift system tables have some latency in getting data from queries. In addition, these tables only maintain logs for 2-5 days. You can find more information from the official documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/logs-redshift-database-cluster/).

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Also supports PostGIS extensions
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional SQL profiling
- Table lineage

:::tip

You can also get fine-grained usage statistics for Redshift using the `redshift-usage` source described below.

:::

### Prerequisites

This source needs to access system tables that require extra permissions.
To grant these permissions, please alter your datahub Redshift user the following way:

```sql
ALTER USER datahub_user WITH SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svv_table_info to datahub_user;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svl_user_info to datahub_user;
```

:::note

Giving a user unrestricted access to system tables gives the user visibility to data generated by other users. For example, STL_QUERY and STL_QUERYTEXT contain the full text of INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

:::

### Lineage

There are multiple lineage collector implementations as Redshift does not support table lineage out of the box.

#### stl_scan_based

The stl_scan based collector uses Redshift's [stl_insert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_INSERT.html) and [stl_scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_SCAN.html) system tables to
discover lineage between tables.
Pros:

- Fast
- Reliable

Cons:

- Does not work with Spectrum/external tables because those scans do not show up in stl_scan table.
- If a table is depending on a view then the view won't be listed as dependency. Instead the table will be connected with the view's dependencies.

#### sql_based

The sql_based based collector uses Redshift's [stl_insert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_INSERT.html) to discover all the insert queries
and uses sql parsing to discover the dependecies.

Pros:

- Works with Spectrum tables
- Views are connected properly if a table depends on it

Cons:

- Slow.
- Less reliable as the query parser can fail on certain queries

#### mixed

Using both collector above and first applying the sql based and then the stl_scan based one.

Pros:

- Works with Spectrum tables
- Views are connected properly if a table depends on it
- A bit more reliable than the sql_based one only

Cons:

- Slow
- May be incorrect at times as the query parser can fail on certain queries

:::note

The redshift stl redshift tables which are used for getting data lineage only retain approximately two to five days of log history. This means you cannot extract lineage from queries issued outside that window.

:::

### CLI based Ingestion

#### Install the Plugin

```shell
pip install 'acryl-datahub[redshift-legacy]'
```

![Certified](https://img.shields.io/badge/support%20status-certified-brightgreen)

### Important Capabilities

| Capability                                          | Status | Notes              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| [Platform Instance](../../../platform-instances.md) | ✅     | Enabled by default |

This plugin extracts usage statistics for datasets in Amazon Redshift.

Note: Usage information is computed by querying the following system tables -

1. stl_scan
2. svv_table_info
3. stl_query
4. svl_user_info

To grant access this plugin for all system tables, please alter your datahub Redshift user the following way:

```sql
ALTER USER datahub_user WITH SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED;
```

This plugin has the below functionalities -

1. For a specific dataset this plugin ingests the following statistics -
   1. top n queries.
   2. top users.
2. Aggregation of these statistics into buckets, by day or hour granularity.

:::note

This source only does usage statistics. To get the tables, views, and schemas in your Redshift warehouse, ingest using the `redshift` source described above.

:::

:::note

Redshift system tables have some latency in getting data from queries. In addition, these tables only maintain logs for 2-5 days. You can find more information from the official documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/logs-redshift-database-cluster/).

:::

### CLI based Ingestion

#### Install the Plugin

```shell
pip install 'acryl-datahub[redshift-usage-legacy]'
```
