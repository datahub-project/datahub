// The intent of this file is to change some of the default variables in bootstrap.
// Although we are trying to remove bootstrap from our codebase and replace it
// entirely with @nacho-ui, we are still using it for some aspects.

// ------------ START Disabling Responsive Layout -------------------------------------
// Disabling resposive layout since we are not really responsive, and it does not
// really work for us at this time. Instead of resizing components we will show a
// scroll bar at bottom which will make the page usable using scroll bars.
// This change is in conjunction with `/styles/base/_base.scss` removing `overflow-x: hidden;`
// to allow page to scroll horizontally.

// Extra small screen / phone
$screen-xs: 1px;
$screen-xs-min: $screen-xs;
$screen-phone: $screen-xs-min;

// Small screen / tablet
$screen-sm: 2px;
$screen-sm-min: $screen-sm;
$screen-tablet: $screen-sm-min;

// Medium screen / desktop
$screen-md: 3px;
$screen-md-min: $screen-md;
$screen-desktop: $screen-md-min;

// Large screen / wide desktop
$screen-lg: 4px;
$screen-lg-min: $screen-lg;
$screen-lg-desktop: $screen-lg-min;

// ------------ END Disabling Responsive Layout -------------------------------------
