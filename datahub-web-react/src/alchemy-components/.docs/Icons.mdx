	## Icons

    Under the hood, we're utilizing the Material Design Icon Library. However, we've crafted out own resuable component to make it easier to use these icons in our application.

    </a>

    In addition to using Materials Design Icons, we've also added a few custom icons to the library. You can access them through the same `<Icon />` component and are represented in the list of available options below.

    ```tsx
    import { Icon } from '@components';

    <Icon icon="AccountCircle" />
    ```

    <br />

    ### Gallery

    There are {AVAILABLE_ICONS.length} icons available. <br />
    Name values populate the `icon` prop on the `<Icon />` component.

    <IconGalleryWithSearch icons={AVAILABLE_ICONS} />

</div>
