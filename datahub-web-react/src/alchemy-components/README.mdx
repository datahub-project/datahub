# Alchemy Component Library

This is a comprehensive library of accessible and reusable React components that streamlines the development of Acryl's applications and websites. The library offers a diverse range of components that can be easily combined to build complex user interfaces while adhering to accessibility best practices.

### Component Usage

It's easy to use the components availble in the library. Simply import the component and use it anywhere you're rendering React components.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@components';

function YourComponent() {
    return <Button>Click me!</Button>;
}
```

In addition to the components themselves, you can also import their types:

```tsx
import type { ButtonProps } from '@components';
```

### Theme Usage

This component library comes with a complete theme utility that pre-defines all of our styling atoms and makes them accessible at `@components/theme`.

```tsx
import { colors } from '@components/theme';

function YourComponent() {
	return (
		<div style={{ bgColor: colors.green.400 }}>
			This div has a green background!
		</div>
	)
}
```

You can access the theme types at `@components/theme/types` and the theme config at `@components/theme/config`.

### Writing Docs

Our docs are generated using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and deployed to [Cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

-   Storybook config is located at `.storybook`
-   Static doc files are located at `alchemy-components/.docs`
-   Component stories are located in each component directory: <br/>`alchemy-components/components/Component/Component.stories.tsx`

Storybook serves as our playground for developing components. You can start it locally:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This launches the docs app at `localhost:6006` and enables everything you need to quickly develop and document components.

### Contributing

Building a component library is a collaboriate effort! We're aiming to provide a first-class experience, so here's a list of the standards we'll be looking for:

-   Consitent prop and variant naming conventions: <br />
    -- `variant` is used to define style types, such as `outline` or `filled`. <br />
    -- `color` is used to define the components color, such as `violet` or `blue`. <br />
    -- `size` is used to define the components size, such as `xs` or `4xl`. <br />
    -- Booleans are prefixed with `is`: `isLoading` or `isDisabled`.
-   All style props have a correseponding theme type, ie. `FontSizeOptions`.
-   All components have an export of default props.
-   Styles are defined using `style objects` instead of `tagged template literals`.
-   Stories are organized into the correct directory .

### FAQs

-   **How are components being styled?** <br />Our components are built using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) that dynamically generate styles based on variant selection.
