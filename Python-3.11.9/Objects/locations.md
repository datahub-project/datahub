# Locations table

For versions up to 3.10 see ./lnotab_notes.txt

In version 3.11 the `co_linetable` bytes object of code objects contains a compact representation of the positions returned by the `co_positions()` iterator.

The `co_linetable` consists of a sequence of location entries.
Each entry starts with a byte with the most significant bit set, followed by zero or more bytes with most significant bit unset.

Each entry contains the following information:

- The number of code units covered by this entry (length)
- The start line
- The end line
- The start column
- The end column

The first byte has the following format:

| Bit 7 | Bits 3-6 | Bits 0-2                   |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| 1     | Code     | Length (in code units) - 1 |

The codes are enumerated in the `_PyCodeLocationInfoKind` enum.

## Variable length integer encodings

Integers are often encoded using a variable length integer encoding

### Unsigned integers (varint)

Unsigned integers are encoded in 6 bit chunks, least significant first.
Each chunk but the last has bit 6 set.
For example:

- 63 is encoded as `0x3f`
- 200 is encoded as `0x48`, `0x03`

### Signed integers (svarint)

Signed integers are encoded by converting them to unsigned integers, using the following function:

```Python
def convert(s):
    if s < 0:
        return ((-s)<<1) | 1
    else:
        return (s<<1)
```

## Location entries

The meaning of the codes and the following bytes are as follows:

| Code  | Meaning        | Start line    | End line | Start column  | End column    |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0-9   | Short form     | Δ 0           | Δ 0      | See below     | See below     |
| 10-12 | One line form  | Δ (code - 10) | Δ 0      | unsigned byte | unsigned byte |
| 13    | No column info | Δ svarint     | Δ 0      | None          | None          |
| 14    | Long form      | Δ svarint     | Δ varint | varint        | varint        |
| 15    | No location    | None          | None     | None          | None          |

The Δ means the value is encoded as a delta from another value:

- Start line: Delta from the previous start line, or `co_firstlineno` for the first entry.
- End line: Delta from the start line

### The short forms

Codes 0-9 are the short forms. The short form consists of two bytes, the second byte holding additional column information. The code is the start column divided by 8 (and rounded down).

- Start column: `(code*8) + ((second_byte>>4)&7)`
- End column: `start_column + (second_byte&15)`
