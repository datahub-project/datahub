# FileStreamMicroBatchStreamStrategy.java

## Status: Entirely DataHub-Specific Implementation

This file is a **complete custom implementation** by DataHub and has **no upstream equivalent** in OpenLineage.

## Purpose

Provides support for file-based streaming sources in Spark Structured Streaming micro-batch mode. This strategy extracts lineage information from streaming queries that read from file sources.

## Key Features

- Detects file-based streaming sources in micro-batch execution
- Extracts input dataset information from streaming execution plans
- Integrates with DataHub's streaming lineage tracking

## Maintenance

Since this is entirely custom code:
- No upstream changes to merge during OpenLineage upgrades
- Maintained independently by DataHub team
- No patch file needed (entire file is custom)
