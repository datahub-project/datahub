# This file is used by the CLI to map quickstart version "labels" to docker tags and git refs.
# It can also be used to override the defaults if master is broken, and to
# map broken releases to fixed ones.
#
# If --version is specified during CLI run:
# - If the version exists in this file, the details will be used.
# - The handling of `stable` is special. See below.
# - Otherwise, we'll assume that it represents a docker-compose git ref and docker tag.
#   e.g. `--version v0.x.y` will use the v0.x.y tag for all images and the compose file from the v0.x.y git tag.
# - If no version is specified the "default" key will be used.
#
# This file can also be used to map broken releases to fixed ones.
#   key is the broken release
#   .composefile_git_ref: the git ref of the compose file to use
#   .docker_tag: the docker tag to use
#
# In case `--version stable` is specified AND the stable key is not defined here,
# the latest released version will be used (by querying the github api)
# As such, the mapping for stable is not required, but can be used to override the latest release.
