## Slim vs Full Image Build

There are two versions of this image. One includes pyspark and Oracle dependencies and is larger due to the java dependencies.

Running the standard build results in the `slim` image without pyspark being generated by default. In order to build the full
image with pyspark use the following project property `-PdockerTarget=full`.
