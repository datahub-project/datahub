We can accept only vulnerability reports at this address.

It's not mandatory, but if you'd like to encrypt your message to us; please use our PGP key. The key fingerprint is:

DataHub will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

**Important:** We ask you to not disclose the vulnerability before it have been fixed and announced, unless you received a response from the DataHub security team that you can do so.

## Security announcements

We maintain [Security Advisories](https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories) on the DataHub project GitHub repository,
where we will post a summary, remediation, and mitigation details for any patch containing security fixes.
