    * `after` (`String`): The cursor to receive the next page of
      objects. If no cursor is supplied it will start at the beginning
      of the list. Offset can not be set at the same time. This is the
      preferred API to use if possible as it is faster.
    * `filter` (`View_Filter`): Filter by GraphQL field and given
      value
    * `first` (`Int`): Maximum number of objects to be returned in a
      page. The default is 100
    * `offset` (`Int`): The number of entries to offset the start of
      the page by. If no offset is supplied it will start at the
      beginning of the list. After can not be set at the same time.
    * `order_by` (`ViewSortOrder`): Sort by given fields. The sort
      orders defined first in the list will take priority. If there
      are no given sort orders or a tie on the final sorted field then
      the resulting set will be sorted by ID in ascending order.
    * `permission_mode` (`PermissionMode`): Results filtering mode.
