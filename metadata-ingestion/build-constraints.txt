# setuptools 82.0.0 removed pkg_resources, which breaks building third-party
# packages (e.g. flatdict via okta) that import pkg_resources in their setup.py.
# This file is passed via --build-constraint to uv pip install, ensuring the
# build isolation environments use a compatible setuptools version.
