# Metadata File

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

Works with `acryl-datahub` out of the box.

## Capabilities

Outputs metadata to a file. This can be used to decouple metadata sourcing from the
process of pushing it into DataHub, and is particularly useful for debugging purposes.
Note that the [file source](../../docs/generated/ingestion/sources/metadata-file.md) can read files generated by this sink.

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  # source configs

sink:
  type: file
  config:
    filename: ./path/to/mce/file.json
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

| Field | Required | Default | Description               |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| path  | âœ…       |         | Path to file to write to. |
