# Great Expectations

This guide helps to setup and configure `DataHubValidationAction` in Great Expectations to send assertions(expectations) and their results to DataHub using DataHub's Python Rest emitter.

## Capabilities

`DataHubValidationAction` pushes assertions metadata to DataHub. This includes

- **Assertion Details**: Details of assertions (i.e. expectation) set on a Dataset (Table).
- **Assertion Results**: Evaluation results for an assertion tracked over time.

This integration supports v3 api datasources using SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine.

## Limitations

This integration does not support

- v2 Datasources such as SqlAlchemyDataset
- v3 Datasources using execution engine other than SqlAlchemyExecutionEngine (Spark, Pandas)
- Cross-dataset expectations (those involving > 1 table)

## Setting up

1. Install the required dependency in your Great Expectations environment.

   ```shell
   pip install 'acryl-datahub-gx-plugin'
   ```

2. To add `DataHubValidationAction` in Great Expectations Checkpoint, add following configuration in action_list for your Great Expectations `Checkpoint`. For more details on setting action_list, see [Checkpoints and Actions](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/reference/checkpoints_and_actions/)
   ```yml
   action_list:
     - name: datahub_action
       action:
         module_name: datahub_gx_plugin.action
         class_name: DataHubValidationAction
         server_url: http://localhost:8080 #datahub server url
   ```
   **Configuration options:**
   - `server_url` (required): URL of DataHub GMS endpoint
   - `env` (optional, defaults to "PROD"): Environment to use in namespace when constructing dataset URNs.
   - `exclude_dbname` (optional): Exclude dbname / catalog when constructing dataset URNs. (Highly applicable to Trino / Presto where we want to omit catalog e.g. `hive`)
   - `platform_alias` (optional): Platform alias when constructing dataset URNs. e.g. main data platform is `presto-on-hive` but using `trino` to run the test
   - `platform_instance_map` (optional): Platform instance mapping to use when constructing dataset URNs. Maps the GX 'data source' name to a platform instance on DataHub. e.g. `platform_instance_map: { "datasource_name": "warehouse" }`
   - `graceful_exceptions` (defaults to true): If set to true, most runtime errors in the lineage backend will be suppressed and will not cause the overall checkpoint to fail. Note that configuration issues will still throw exceptions.
   - `token` (optional): Bearer token used for authentication.
   - `timeout_sec` (optional): Per-HTTP request timeout.
   - `retry_status_codes` (optional): Retry HTTP request also on these status codes.
   - `retry_max_times` (optional): Maximum times to retry if HTTP request fails. The delay between retries is increased exponentially.
   - `extra_headers` (optional): Extra headers which will be added to the datahub request.
   - `parse_table_names_from_sql` (defaults to false): The integration can use an SQL parser to try to parse the datasets being asserted. This parsing is disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `parse_table_names_from_sql: True`. The parser is based on the [`sqllineage`](https://pypi.org/project/sqllineage/) package.
   - `convert_urns_to_lowercase` (optional): Whether to convert dataset urns to lowercase.

## Debugging

Set environment variable `DATAHUB_DEBUG` (default `false`) to `true` to enable debug logging for `DataHubValidationAction`.
