# Custom transformer script

This script sets up a transformer that reads in a list of owner URNs from a JSON file specified via `owners_json` and appends these owners to every MCE.

See the transformers tutorial (https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-ingestion/docs/transformer/intro) for how this module is built and run.
