NOTE: these integration tests only run against Db2 for LUW, as that
is the only variant of Db2 that is freely-available and runs on most
users' computers.

For testing against Db2 for IBM i (AS/400), a real server, such as
that provided by https://pub400.com/ , must be used. In the interest
of not overburdening the public resource that is PUB400.com, automated
tests against it are not performed.

If you find a freely available Db2 for z/OS server to test against,
please update this note.
