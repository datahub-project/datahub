# Embedded/distributed ZK TLS connection support can be activated by setting these properties at minimum:
#
# secureClientPort=2281
# serverCnxnFactory=org.apache.zookeeper.server.NettyServerCnxnFactory

# Most TLS configurations will set these values as well:
#
# ssl.keyStore.location=/example/path/to/key-store.jks
# ssl.keyStore.password=change this value to the actual value in your installation
# ssl.trustStore.location=/example/path/to/trust-store.jks
# ssl.trustStore.password=change this value to the actual value in your installation
# ssl.hostnameVerification=false
#
# Note that many ZK parameters can set as Java system properties, refer to the ZK admin guide for details:
#
# https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_configuration

# Other common settings:
#
# client.portUnification=true
# admin.enableServer=false

# The server string has changed as of 3.5.5 and the client port is now specified at the end of the server string:
# https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.5/zookeeperReconfig.html#sc_reconfig_clientport
#
# Specifies the servers that are part of this zookeeper ensemble. For
# every NiFi instance running an embedded zookeeper, there needs to be
# a server entry below. Client port is now specified at the end of the string
# after a semi-colon.
#
# For instance:
#
# server.1=nifi-node1-hostname:2888:3888;2181
# server.2=nifi-node2-hostname:2888:3888;2181
# server.3=nifi-node3-hostname:2888:3888;2181
#
# The index of the server corresponds to the myid file that gets created
# in the dataDir of each node running an embedded zookeeper. See the
# administration guide for more details.
