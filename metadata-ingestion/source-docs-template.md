## Integration Details

<!-- Plain-language description of what this integration is meant to do.  -->
<!-- Include details about where metadata is extracted from (ie. logs, source API, manifest, etc.)   -->

### Concept Mapping

<!-- This should be a manual mapping of concepts from the source to the DataHub Metadata Model -->
<!-- Authors should provide as much context as possible about how this mapping was generated, including assumptions made, known shortcuts, & any other caveats -->

This ingestion source maps the following Source System Concepts to DataHub Concepts:

<!-- Remove all unnecessary/irrevant DataHub Concepts -->

## Metadata Ingestion Quickstart

### Prerequisites

In order to ingest metadata from [Source Name], you will need:

- eg. Python version, source version, source access requirements
- eg. Steps to configure source access
- ...

### Install the Plugin(s)

Run the following commands to install the relevant plugin(s):

`pip install 'acryl-datahub[source-name]'`

`pip install 'acryl-datahub[source-usage-name]'`

### Configure the Ingestion Recipe(s)

Use the following recipe(s) to get started with ingestion.

_For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes)._

#### `'acryl-datahub[source-name]'`

```yml
source:
  type: source_name
  config:
    # Required fields
    option1: value1

sink:
  # sink configs
```

<details>
  <summary>View All Recipe Configuartion Options</summary>
  
  | Field | Required | Default | Description |
  | --- | :-: | :-: | --- |
  | `field1` | ✅ | `default_value` | A required field with a default value |
  | `field2` | ❌ | `default_value` | An optional field with a default value |
  | `field3` | ❌ | | An optional field without a default value |
  | ... | | |
</details>

#### `'acryl-datahub[source-usage-name]'`

```yml
source:
  type: source-usage-name
  config:
    # Required Fields
    option1: value1

    # Options
    top_n_queries: 10

sink:
  # sink configs
```

<details>

  | Field | Required | Default | Description |
  | --- | :-: | :-: | --- |
  | `field1` | ✅ | `default_value` | A required field with a default value |
  | `field2` | ❌ | `default_value` | An optional field with a default value |
