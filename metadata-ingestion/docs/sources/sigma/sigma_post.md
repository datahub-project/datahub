### Capabilities

Use the **Important Capabilities** table above as the source of truth for supported features and whether additional configuration is required.

##### Chart source platform mapping

If you want to provide platform details(platform name, platform instance and env) for chart's all external upstream data sources, then you can use `chart_sources_platform_mapping` as below:

##### Example - For just one specific chart's external upstream data sources

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name/workbook_name/chart_name_1":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD

  "workspace_name/folder_name/workbook_name/chart_name_2":
    data_source_platform: postgres
    platform_instance: cloud_instance
    env: DEV
```

##### Example - For all charts within one specific workbook

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name/workbook_name_1":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD

  "workspace_name/folder_name/workbook_name_2":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```

##### Example - For all workbooks charts within one specific workspace

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```

##### Example - All workbooks use the same connection

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "*":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```

### Limitations

Module behavior is constrained by source APIs, permissions, and metadata exposed by the platform. Refer to capability notes for unsupported or conditional features.

### Troubleshooting

If ingestion fails, validate credentials, permissions, connectivity, and scope filters first. Then review ingestion logs for source-specific errors and adjust configuration accordingly.
