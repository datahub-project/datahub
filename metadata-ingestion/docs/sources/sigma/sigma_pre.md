## Integration Details

This source extracts the following:

- Workspaces and workbooks within that workspaces as Container.
- Sigma Datasets as Datahub Datasets.
- Pages as Datahub dashboards and elements present inside pages as charts.

## Configuration Notes

1. Refer [doc](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/generate-api-client-credentials) to generate an API client credentials.
2. Provide the generated Client ID and Secret in Recipe.

We have observed issues with the Sigma API, where certain API endpoints do not return the expected results, even when the user is an admin. In those cases, a workaround is to manually add the user associated with the Client ID/Secret to each workspace with missing metadata.
Empty workspaces are listed in the ingestion report in the logs with the key `empty_workspaces`.

## Advanced Configurations

### Chart source platform mapping

If you want to provide platform details(platform name, platform instance and env) for chart's all external upstream data sources, then you can use `chart_sources_platform_mapping` as below:

#### Example - For just one specific chart's external upstream data sources

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name/workbook_name/chart_name_1":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD

  "workspace_name/folder_name/workbook_name/chart_name_2":
    data_source_platform: postgres
    platform_instance: cloud_instance
    env: DEV
```

#### Example - For all charts within one specific workbook

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name/workbook_name_1":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD

  "workspace_name/folder_name/workbook_name_2":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```

#### Example - For all workbooks charts within one specific workspace

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "workspace_name":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```

#### Example - All workbooks use the same connection

```yml
chart_sources_platform_mapping:
  "*":
    data_source_platform: snowflake
    platform_instance: new_instance
    env: PROD
```
