### Prerequisites

#### Set up the right permissions

You need to provide the following permissions for ingestion to work correctly.

```
access_data
explore
manage_models
see_datagroups
see_lookml
see_lookml_dashboards
see_looks
see_pdts
see_queries
see_schedules
see_sql
see_system_activity
see_user_dashboards
see_users
```

Here is an example permission set after configuration.

</p>

#### Get an API key

You need to get an API key for the account with the above privileges to perform ingestion. See the [Looker authentication docs](https://docs.looker.com/reference/api-and-integration/api-auth#authentication_with_an_sdk) for the steps to create a client ID and secret.

### Ingestion through UI

The following video shows you how to get started with ingesting Looker metadata through the UI.

:::note

You will need to run `lookml` ingestion through the CLI after you have ingested Looker metadata through the UI. Otherwise you will not be able to see Looker Views and their lineage to your warehouse tables.
