If you were using `database_alias` in one of your other ingestions to rename your databases to something else based on business needs you can rename them in superset also

```yml
source:
  type: superset
  config:
    # Coordinates
    connect_uri: http://localhost:8088

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass
    provider: ldap
    database_alias:
      example_name_1: business_name_1
      example_name_2: business_name_2

sink:
  # sink configs
```

### Capabilities

Use the **Important Capabilities** table above as the source of truth for supported features and whether additional configuration is required.

### Limitations

Module behavior is constrained by source APIs, permissions, and metadata exposed by the platform. Refer to capability notes for unsupported or conditional features.

### Troubleshooting

If ingestion fails, validate credentials, permissions, connectivity, and scope filters first. Then review ingestion logs for source-specific errors and adjust configuration accordingly.
