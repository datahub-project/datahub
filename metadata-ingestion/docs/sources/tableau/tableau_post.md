### Capabilities

Use the **Important Capabilities** table above as the source of truth for supported features and whether additional configuration is required.

### Limitations

Module behavior is constrained by source APIs, permissions, and metadata exposed by the platform. Refer to capability notes for unsupported or conditional features.

### Troubleshooting

#### Why are only some workbooks/custom SQLs/published datasources ingested from the specified project?

This may happen when the Tableau API returns NODE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED error in response to metadata query and returns partial results with message "Showing partial results. , The request exceeded the ‘n’ node limit. Use pagination, additional filtering, or both in the query to adjust results." To resolve this, consider

- reducing the page size using the `page_size` config param in datahub recipe (Defaults to 10).
- increasing tableau configuration [metadata query node limit](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/cli_configuration-set_tsm.htm#metadata_nodelimit) to higher value.

#### `PERMISSIONS_MODE_SWITCHED` error in ingestion report

This error occurs if the Tableau site is using external assets. For more detail, refer to the Tableau documentation [Manage Permissions for External Assets](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/dm_perms_assets.htm).

Follow the below steps to enable the derived permissions:

1.  Sign in to Tableau Cloud or Tableau Server as an admin.
2.  From the left navigation pane, click Settings.
3.  On the General tab, under Automatic Access to Metadata about Databases and Tables, select the `Automatically grant authorized users access to metadata about databases and tables` check box.

#### Troubleshooting

If ingestion fails, validate credentials, permissions, connectivity, and scope filters first. Then review ingestion logs for source-specific errors and adjust configuration accordingly.
