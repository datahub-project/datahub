### Capabilities

Use the **Important Capabilities** table above as the source of truth for supported features and whether additional configuration is required.

### Limitations

Module behavior is constrained by source APIs, permissions, and metadata exposed by the platform. Refer to capability notes for unsupported or conditional features.

### Troubleshooting

#### No data lineage captured or missing lineage

Check that you meet the [Unity Catalog lineage requirements](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html#requirements).

Also check the [Unity Catalog limitations](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html#limitations) to make sure that lineage would be expected to exist in this case.

#### Lineage extraction is too slow

Unity Catalog REST API requires one call per table (table lineage) and one call per column (column lineage). To improve performance, disable column lineage with `include_column_lineage: false`.

### Advanced

#### Multiple Databricks Workspaces

If you have multiple databricks workspaces **that point to the same Unity Catalog metastore**, our suggestion is to use separate recipes for ingesting the workspace-specific Hive Metastore catalog and Unity Catalog metastore's information schema.

To ingest Hive metastore information schema

- Setup one ingestion recipe per workspace
- Use platform instance equivalent to workspace name
- Ingest only hive_metastore catalog in the recipe using config `catalogs: ["hive_metastore"]`

To ingest Unity Catalog information schema

- Disable hive metastore catalog ingestion in the recipe using config `include_hive_metastore: False`
- Ideally, just ingest from one workspace
- To ingest from both workspaces (e.g. if each workspace has different permissions and therefore restricted view of the UC metastore):
  - Use same platform instance for all workspaces using same UC metastore
  - Ingest usage from only one workspace (you lose usage from other workspace)
  - Use filters to only ingest each catalog once, but shouldn’t be necessary
