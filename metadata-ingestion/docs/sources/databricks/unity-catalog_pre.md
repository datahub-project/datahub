### Prerequisities

- Get your Databricks instance's [workspace url](https://docs.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids)
- Create a [Databricks Service Principal](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#what-is-a-service-principal)
  - You can skip this step and use your own account to get things running quickly,
    but we strongly recommend creating a dedicated service principal for production use.
- Generate a Databricks Personal Access token following the following guides:
  - [Service Principals](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#personal-access-tokens)
  - [Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens)
- Provision your service account:
  - To ingest your workspace's metadata and lineage, your service principal must have all of the following:
    - One of: metastore admin role, ownership of, or `USE CATALOG` privilege on any catalogs you want to ingest
    - One of: metastore admin role, ownership of, or `USE SCHEMA` privilege on any schemas you want to ingest
    - Ownership of or `SELECT` privilege on any tables and views you want to ingest
    - [Ownership documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/ownership.html)
    - [Privileges documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html)
  - To ingest legacy hive_metastore catalog (`include_hive_metastore` - enabled by default), your service principal must have all of the following:
    - `READ_METADATA` and `USAGE` privilege on `hive_metastore` catalog
    - `READ_METADATA` and `USAGE` privilege on schemas you want to ingest
    - `READ_METADATA` and `USAGE` privilege on tables and views you want to ingest
    - [Hive Metastore Privileges documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-privileges-hms.html)
  - To ingest your workspace's notebooks and respective lineage, your service principal must have `CAN_READ` privileges on the folders containing the notebooks you want to ingest: [guide](https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#folder-permissions).
  - To `include_usage_statistics` (enabled by default), your service principal must have `CAN_MANAGE` permissions on any SQL Warehouses you want to ingest: [guide](https://docs.databricks.com/security/auth-authz/access-control/sql-endpoint-acl.html).
  - To ingest `profiling` information with `method: ge`, you need `SELECT` privileges on all profiled tables.
  - To ingest `profiling` information with `method: analyze` and `call_analyze: true` (enabled by default), your service principal must have ownership or `MODIFY` privilege on any tables you want to profile.
    - Alternatively, you can run [ANALYZE TABLE](https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-aux-analyze-table.html) yourself on any tables you want to profile, then set `call_analyze` to `false`.
      You will still need `SELECT` privilege on those tables to fetch the results.
- Check the starter recipe below and replace `workspace_url` and `token` with your information from the previous steps.
