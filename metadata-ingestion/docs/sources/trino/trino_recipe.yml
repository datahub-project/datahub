    # Optional -- A mapping of trino catalog to its connector details like connector database, env and platform instance.
    # This configuration is used to ingest lineage of datasets to connectors. Use catalog name as key.
    # See docs/sources/trino/trino_pre.md for list of all supported connectors and tier classification.
    # catalog_to_connector_details:
    #   # Example: Two-tier connector (Hive, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
    #   hive_catalog:
    #     connector_platform: hive
    #     platform_instance: prod_hive  # Optional
    #     env: PROD  # Optional
    #   
    #   # Example: Three-tier connector (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Oracle, etc.)
    #   # Note: connector_database is REQUIRED for three-tier connectors
    #   postgres_catalog:
    #     connector_database: my_database  # Required for 3-tier
    #     connector_platform: postgresql
    #     platform_instance: prod_postgres  # Optional

    # Optional -- Whether to ingest dataset-level lineage to upstream connectors (default: true)
    # ingest_lineage_to_connectors: true
    
    # Optional -- Whether to ingest column-level lineage to upstream connectors (default: true)
    # Requires ingest_lineage_to_connectors to be enabled.
    # 
    # IMPORTANT - Performance Impact:
    # - Makes 2x database queries (1 extra per table/view for column metadata)
    # - For 1000 tables, adds ~2-5 minutes to ingestion time
    # - Consider disabling for large deployments (1000+ tables) or setting to false during initial testing
    #
    # How it works:
    # - Creates 1:1 column mappings between Trino columns and upstream connector columns
    # - Assumes column names match between Trino and upstream (which is correct for Trino's architecture)
    # - Does NOT handle complex transformations in Trino-specific views (use include_view_lineage for that)
    #
    # Limitations:
    # - 1:1 name-based mapping (column names must match between Trino and upstream)
    # - Additional latency per table/view
    # - See docs/sources/trino/trino_pre.md for full details on supported connectors and limitations
    # 
    # include_column_lineage: true
    
    # Optional -- Whether to use incremental lineage (default: false)
    # When enabled, emits lineage as incremental to existing lineage in DataHub.
    # When disabled, re-states all lineage on each run.
    # incremental_lineage: false
