### Capabilities

The connector extracts the following metadata:

- **Cubes and views** as datasets, grouped under a container representing the deployment. The container links back to the deployment UI (derived from `api_url`, or set `deployment_url`).
- **Schema** — each measure and dimension becomes a schema field. Measures carry their aggregation type (e.g. `count`, `sum`) in the native data type; primary-key dimensions are flagged as part of the key. Fields are tagged `Measure` or `Dimension` — and `Temporal` for time dimensions (disable with `tag_measures_and_dimensions: false`).
- **Descriptions and properties** — titles, descriptions, segment names, source file name, and any custom `meta` defined in the model.
- **Structural metadata** — joins (with relationship), hierarchies (with levels), folders/nested folders (with members), and pre-aggregation names are captured as dataset custom properties (disable with `emit_member_details: false`).
- **Measure presentation hints** — each measure's `format`, drill-down members, and cumulative flag are stored on the schema field as `jsonProps`.
- **Hidden members** — cubes, views, and members marked `public: false` / `isVisible: false` are skipped by default; set `include_hidden: true` to ingest them.
- **Tags, glossary terms, owners, domains, and documentation links** — derived from the `meta` defined on cubes/views via `meta_mapping`, and from member `meta` via `column_meta_mapping` (same syntax as the dbt connector). Domains can also be assigned by name pattern via the `domain` config.
- **Siblings** — a cube that is a 1:1 projection of a single warehouse table (not a view, no joins) is linked to that table as a DataHub sibling, mirroring the dbt connector (disable with `emit_siblings: false`).

#### Lineage

Lineage is emitted when `ingest_lineage` is enabled (the default):

- **View to cube** — views are linked to the cubes they are built on, including column-level lineage derived from each member's `aliasMember`.
- **Cube to warehouse** — on Cube Cloud with the Metadata API, table and column references are read directly. On Cube Core, table-level lineage is parsed from each cube's SQL definition when `parse_sql_for_lineage` and `warehouse_platform` are set.

Disable column-level lineage with `include_column_lineage: false`.

#### Cube Cloud authentication and metadata merging

On Cube Cloud the connector reads both endpoints and merges them: `/v1/meta` supplies the structural and presentation metadata (joins, hierarchies, folders, formats, visibility), while the [Metadata API](https://docs.cube.dev/reference/control-plane-api) (`/v1/entities`, `/v1/data-sources`) supplies warehouse and column-level lineage. This gives a Cloud ingestion the union of both.

The Metadata API requires a metadata-scoped JWT. You can either:

- Provide a pre-generated token in `api_token`, or
- Let the connector mint one automatically: set `cloud_api_key` (a Cube Cloud API key from Account → API keys) together with `deployment_id` and `environment_id`. The connector calls the Control Plane `tokens-for-meta-sync` endpoint to obtain a short-lived, metadata-only token. Override the Control Plane host with `cloud_api_url` if it differs from the `api_url` host, and embed a `security_context` to scope multi-tenant visibility.

If the Metadata API cannot be reached, the connector logs a warning and continues with `/v1/meta` only (structural metadata and view-to-cube lineage, but no warehouse lineage).

#### Multi-tenancy and context variables

Cube [context variables](https://cube.dev/docs/reference/data-model/context-variables) (`COMPILE_CONTEXT`, `SECURITY_CONTEXT`, `FILTER_PARAMS`, `FILTER_GROUP`, `SQL_UTILS`) are data-model authoring constructs, not metadata the APIs expose as structured fields — there is nothing separate to ingest. They affect the connector only indirectly:

- **`COMPILE_CONTEXT` (multi-tenancy).** Cube compiles a different data model per security context. The connector ingests the single compiled model that matches the security context carried by its token: set `security_context` when minting a token via the Control Plane API, or rely on the claims baked into a directly-supplied `api_token`. To catalog multiple tenants, run one ingestion per tenant — but their cubes and views share names, so distinguish them with `platform_instance` / `env` (or `cube_pattern` / `view_pattern`) to avoid URN collisions.
- **`FILTER_PARAMS` / `SQL_UTILS` in cube SQL.** The SQL returned by `/v1/meta` is already compiled (`FILTER_PARAMS` render to their defaults and `COMPILE_CONTEXT` is resolved), so Cube Core SQL lineage parsing operates on the resolved SQL and is wrapped defensively if a template still cannot be parsed. On Cube Cloud the Metadata API returns resolved `table_references` / `column_references`, so templating is irrelevant there.

### Limitations

- The `/v1/meta` endpoint does not return cubes or views marked `public: false`. On Cube Cloud the Metadata API may still return them (and the connector merges them in); on Cube Core such cubes are not ingested as datasets, though lineage edges to them are still emitted.
- Warehouse lineage on Cube Cloud requires a metadata-scoped token for the Metadata API (supplied via `api_token`, or minted automatically with `cloud_api_key` + `deployment_id` + `environment_id`). Without it, the connector falls back to `/v1/meta` and only view-to-cube lineage is available.
- The Control Plane **audit-logs export** and **Orchestration API** (pre-aggregation build jobs) are intentionally not used — they are operational/governance surfaces rather than data-catalog metadata, and the audit-logs export is an Enterprise-only CSV stream.
- Column-level lineage from Cube Core SQL parsing is not produced; Core lineage is table-level only.
- **Usage statistics and query profiling are not ingested.** Cube does not expose query history through a pull API — it is only available via [Query History export](https://cube.dev/docs/product/administration/monitoring/query-history-export), which pushes logs to an external sink (e.g. S3). Ingesting that exported data would be a separate pipeline rather than a Metadata API feature.
- Pre-aggregation definitions are not exposed by Cube Core's `/v1/meta` (it returns only `measures`, `dimensions`, `segments`, `hierarchies`, and `folders`); they are an internal caching concern. Where a payload does include them, their names are captured as custom properties.

### Troubleshooting

#### "Required scope is missing" / Metadata API falls back to `/v1/meta`

The configured `api_token` is a regular REST/data token rather than a metadata-scoped token. Either set `cloud_api_key` + `deployment_id` + `environment_id` so the connector mints a metadata token via the Control Plane API, supply a pre-generated metadata token in `api_token`, or set `use_metadata_api: false` to silence the fallback warning.

#### No warehouse lineage appears

Confirm `warehouse_platform` is set (or auto-detected), and that the upstream datasets were ingested with the same `warehouse_platform_instance` and `warehouse_env` you configured here.

#### Warehouse lineage edges do not connect to existing datasets

Warehouses such as Snowflake and BigQuery are typically ingested with lowercased URNs. The connector lowercases upstream warehouse table and column names by default; if the warehouse connector was configured with `convert_urns_to_lowercase: false`, set `convert_lineage_urns_to_lowercase: false` here so the URNs match.
