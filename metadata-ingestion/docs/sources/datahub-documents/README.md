## Overview

Datahub Documents is a documentation or collaboration platform. Learn more in the [official Datahub Documents documentation](https://datahub.com/docs/).

The DataHub integration for Datahub Documents covers document/workspace entities and hierarchy context for knowledge assets. Depending on module capabilities, it can also capture features such as lineage, usage, profiling, ownership, tags, and stateful deletion detection.

## Concept Mapping

The mapping below provides a platform-level view. Module-specific mappings and nuances are documented in each module section.

| Source Concept                                           | DataHub Concept              | Notes                                                            |
