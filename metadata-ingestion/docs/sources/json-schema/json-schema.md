#### Configuration Notes

- You must provide a `platform` field. Most organizations have custom project names for their schema repositories, so you can pick whatever name makes sense. For example, you might want to call your schema platform **schemaregistry**. After picking a custom platform, you can use the [put platform](../../../../docs/cli.md#put-platform) command to register your custom platform into DataHub.
