# Version-specific plugin modules need special handling for type checking:
#
# Architecture:
#   - plugin_v2: Uses Airflow 2.x APIs and standalone openlineage-airflow package
#   - plugin_v2_airflow3: Uses Airflow 3.x APIs and native openlineage provider
#
# Type checking approach:
#   The installed Airflow package provides version-specific type stubs. Since you can't
#   install both Airflow 2.x and 3.x simultaneously, mypy must exclude the incompatible
#   plugin implementation.
#
# Local development - run mypy with exclusions based on your installed Airflow version:
#   With Airflow 2.x: mypy --exclude 'src/datahub_airflow_plugin/plugin_v2_airflow3' src/datahub_airflow_plugin
#   With Airflow 3.x: mypy --exclude 'src/datahub_airflow_plugin/plugin_v2' src/datahub_airflow_plugin
#
# CI/CD - tox automatically checks both implementations with correct stubs:
#   py311-airflow210 env → installs Airflow 2.10 → checks plugin_v2 with Airflow 2.x stubs
#   py311-airflow31 env  → installs Airflow 3.1  → checks plugin_v2_airflow3 with Airflow 3.x stubs

# Ignore Airflow 2.x compatibility issues in example DAGs when running with Airflow 3 stubs
