    # Run mypy type checking with version-specific stubs and exclusions
    #
    # How version-specific type checking works:
    # 1. Each tox env installs a specific Airflow version (via deps section)
    # 2. That Airflow installation provides version-specific type stubs
    # 3. We exclude the incompatible plugin implementation from checking
    #
    # Example: py311-airflow210 environment
    #   - Installs: apache-airflow~=2.10.0 (with Airflow 2.x type stubs)
    #   - Excludes: airflow3 (which uses Airflow 3.x APIs)
    #   - Checks: airflow2 with Airflow 2.10 stubs ✓

    # Example: py311-airflow31 environment
    #   - Installs: apache-airflow~=3.1.0 (with Airflow 3.x type stubs)
