# DataHub Helm Charts

> **Notice**: As of July 2021, we have migrated the helm charts to a separate [repo](https://github.com/acryldata/datahub-helm)
> to allow automatic releases and better control over the discoverability of the charts.
>
> We have also published the helm charts to `https://helm.datahubproject.io`. You can deploy without referring to the codebase by running the following commands.
>
> ```
> helm repo add datahub https://helm.datahubproject.io
> helm install datahub datahub/datahub
> ```
>
> Please contribute any changes to the new repo.
