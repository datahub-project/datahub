DataHub will send you a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security announcements

where we will post a summary, remediation, and mitigation details for any patch containing security fixes.
